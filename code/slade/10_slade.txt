all native joy for your kin,
delight cease! Of land-rights must
of your clan every man
become deprived, when nobles
from afar learn of your flight,
gloryless dead: death is better
for all men than a life of dishonour.' Then he commanded battle-result to be announced at the stronghold,
up over the cliff-edge, where that warrior-band
the morning-long day sat sad in spirit,
shield-bearers, in expectation of two things:
the end of his days or the return
of the dear man. On little was he silent
of the new tidings, he who rode the headland,
but he truly said over all:
'Now is the wish-giver of the Wederas' nation,
the lord of the Geats unmoving on his death-bed,
remaining in the repose of slaughter by the wyrm's deeds;
beside him lies his life-contender
sick with seax-wounds: he could not with his sword
on that fearsome being in any way
inflict wounds; Wiglaf sits
over Beowulf, the son of Weohstan,
one earl over another unliving,
he holds, weary in his mind, head-watch
over beloved and loathed. Now for the nation one expects
time of warfare when unsecret
to the Franks and Frisians, the fall of the king,
widely becomes; the quarrel was shaped
fierce against the Hugas, when Hygelac came faring with a fleet onto the Frisians' land
where him the Hetware attacked in battle,
it happened in courage with over-strength,
that the mailed-warrior had to bow down;
he fell among the foot-troop; not at all ornaments gave
the lord to his retinue; for us was ever after
the Merovingian king's kindness withheld.
I do not from the Swedes peace or truce
expect a bit, but it was widely known
that Ongentheow of life deprived
Haethcyn Hrethel's son at Raven's Wood,
when for arrogance first sought out
the Geatish people the War-Scilfings
at once him the wise, old father of Ohthere,
ancient and terrible, returned onslaught by hand;
he destroyed the sea-wise man, he honoured his wife,
the old, wisened woman bereft of her gold,
Onela's mother and Ohthere's
and then he followed those life-enemies,
until they escaped with difficulty,
into Raven's Wood, without a lord;
then he besieged the huge sacred grove, the survivors of swords
weary with wounds; he often threatened woes
to the wretched company in the length of the night;
said: he in the morning by the edges of a maiche he would sacrifice one of them on the gallow-tree
as game for the birds; relief came back
to the sorrow-spirited ones together with early day,
when they Hygelac's horn and trumpet,
and his battle-yell recognised, then the good man came,
with the tribe's veteran warriors travelling on the path.
The bloody swathe of the Swedes and Geats,
the slaughter-rush of men was widely seen;
how the folk between them awoke a feud;
then the good man went with his fellow kinsmen,
old and wise, greated saddened, to seek a citadel;
the warrior Ongentheow retreated higher up,
he had of Hygelac's battle-skill heard,
the proud man's war-craft; he did not trust his resistance,
that he the sea-men could oppose,
against battle travellers defend the hoard,
children and women; he fell back thence
old behind the earth-wall; then pursuit was offered
to the Swedish nation, the standards of Hygelac
that place of refuge forth overran,
when the Hrethelings pressed forward into that entrenchment.
There was Ongentheow by edges of swords,
the grizzle-haired was compelled to pause,
so that the tribe-king had to submit
to the sole judgement of Eofor; him wrathfully
Wulf, Wonred's son, reached with his weapon,
so that from him by the blow blood in streams sprang
forth beneath his hair; he was not frightened though,
the aged Scilfing, but quickly repaid
with a more terrible response for that slaughter-stroke,
when the tribe-king turned thither;
he could not, the brave son of Wonred,
to the old fellow offer onslaught by hand,
rather he him on his head had sheared his helm,
so that he, blood-stained, had to bow down;
he fell on the field; he was not doomed yet,
but he recovered himself, though the wound touched him;
Let he, the hard thane of Hygelac,
broad maiche, when his brother lay dead,
the old ogrish sword, the giantish helm
break over the shield-wall; then the king bowed down,
the shepherd of the folk, was struck to his life.
Then there were many, who bandaged his kinsman,
they quickly raised him up, when room was made for them,
so that they the place of slaughter were able to control;
then plunder the one man the other,
he took from Ongentheow his iron byrnie,
his hard hilted sword, and his helmet too;
the hoary one's armour he bore to Hygelac;
he took the treasures and fairly pledged to him
rewards among the people, and did so;
he paid for the war-onslaught, the lord of the Geats,
Hrethel's heir, when he returned home,
to Eofor and Wulf with an abundance of treasure;
he gave them both a hundred thousand worth of
land and interlocked rings --he needed not the gifts scorn,
any man on middle-earth, since they gained those glories in fighting--
and then to Eofor he gave his only daughter,
a honour to the home, as pledge of friendship.
That is the feud and the enmity,
the slaughterous hate of men, for which I have woe,
they shall attack us, the Swedish nation,
when they learn our lord
is lifeless, he who formerly preserved
against despisers our hoard and kingdom,
after fall of heroes, bold Scyldings,
supported the welfare of the folk, or moreover
accomplished noble deeds. For me haste is best,
that we the people-king look upon there,
and that one bring, he who gave us rings,
on a journey to the pyre; nor must a part only
melt with that great-spirited one, but there is the treasure's hoard,
gold uncounted, bitterly purchased,
and now at last with his own life
bought the rings: then the blaze must devour,
the fire cover, no man shall wear
these treasures in remembrance, no pretty girl
shall have on her neck ring-adornment,
but must, sad-hearted, bereft of gold,
often, not once, tread in alien land,
now the cohort-leader has laid aside laughter
pleasure and merriment. Therefore must be spears
many, morning-cold, grasped in palms,
raised in hands, not at all the sound of harp
to wake the warrior, but the black raven,
eager over the doomed, speaking many things,
telling the eagle, how he succeeded in eating,
when he with the wolf despoiled the slain.'
So the bold men was teller
of hateful tidings; he did not lie much
in deeds or in words. The troop all arose;
they went unhappily under the eagle's headland,
with welling tears, to gaze upon the wonder;
they found then on the sand, soulless,
ruling over his bed of rest, the who gave them rings
in earlier times; then it was the end-day
come for good men, that the war-king,
the Wederas' chieftain, died a wondrous death.
First they saw there a rarer creature,
the wyrm on the ground just opposite there,
the loathsome one lying dead: the fire-drake was
a grim gruesome guest burnt by flames;
it was fifty foot-measures
long as it lay; in air-joy it had ruled
the times of the night, down again had gone
to seek its den; it was then still in death,
it had of earth-caverns enjoyed its end.
They stood by him goblets and beakers,
lay plates and precious swords,
eaten through by rust, as if they had in the embrace of the earth
a thousand winters remained there;
then was that legacy of exceedingly powerful, gold of men of yore, encompassed by an incantation,
that the ring-hall could not touch
any man, unless God himself,
victories' Truth-king allowed he who He wished
--He is man's protector-- to open the hoard,
even so to every man as it seemed fitting to Him.
Then it was seen that the venture did not benefit
who he unrightly had hidden inside,
vengeance under the walls; this warden earlier slew
one man of a few; then was the feud
wrathfully avenged. It is a wonder where then
a man famed for courage should meet end
of his fated life, when he can no longer
one among his kinsmen, inhabit a mead-hall;
thus it was for Beowulf, when he the barrow's ward
sought treacherous quarrels: he himself did not know
through what his parting from this world must bring about.
Thus until judgement's day deeply declared
the great princes, who put it there,
that the man would be guilty of crimes,
banned from sacred places, in hell-bonds fast,
reproached for his transgressions, he who plundered that place;
he was not liberal with gold nor had he readily
the kindness of a lord ever shown.
Wiglaf spoke, the son of Weohstan,
'Often must many men, for the will of one,
endure exile, as it has happened to us;
we could not convince the beloved prince,
the keeper of the kingdom, by any counsel,
that he not greet the gold-ward,
let him lie, where he long had been,
inhabiting his abodes until the world's end;
he held to his noble destiny; the hoard is exposed,
grimly gained; that was granted
too harshly which him impelled thither.
I was there inside and looked over all of it,
the trappings of the hall, when the way was cleared for me,
not at all sweetly was the errand allowed
inside the earthwall; I seized in haste
much with my hands, a mighty burden
of hoard-treasures, bore it out hither
to my king; he was still alive then,
wise and knowing; he spoke much on many things,
old in his grief, and commanded me greet you all,
bid that you build in accord of your friend's deeds
in the cremation place a high barrow,
large and splendid, as he was of men
a warrior most honoured thought this wide earth,
while he the prosperity of a city could enjoy.
Let us now hasten another time
to see and to seek in that heap of cunningly wrought things,
a wonder under the walls; I shall guide you,
so that you sufficient close-up will see
rings and broad gold; let the bier be ready,
quickly prepared, when we come out,
and then carry our lord,
beloved man, where he must long
in the Ruler's protection endure.'
He then commanded to direct, the son of Weohstan,
the battle-brave hero, many warriors,
house-holders, that they the pyre-wood
to fetch from afar, folk-chieftains,
to the good man: 'Now must the fire devour,
the dim flame grow, the ruler of warriors,
he who often endured shower of iron,
when the storm of arrows, impelled by bow-strings,
shot over the shield-wall; shaft held true to task,
its feather-trappings eager, arrow-head followed.'
Indeed the wise son of Weohstan
summoned from the troop of king's thanes,
seven altogether, the best;
he went, one of eight, under the evil roof
one battle-man bore in his hands
a fire-brand, he who went in the fore-front.
It was not in a casting of lots, who would plunder that hoard,
when unprotected any part
the men saw remaining in the hall,
lying frail; little did anyone mourn
that they quickly carried out
precious treasures; the dragon too they shoved,
the wyrm over the cliff-wall, they let the waves take,
the flood enfold, that keeper of baubles;
that was braided gold loaded on the waggon,
of each kind countless, to the prince bore,
hoary grey from battle, to the whale's headland.
Then for him prepared the people of the Geats a pyre on the earth, not trifling,
hung with helmets, with battle-shields,
with bright byrnies, as he had requested;
they laid then in the midst the famed chieftain,
the lamenting heroes, their belovèd lord;
then began on the barrow the greatest bale-fire,
the warriors to kindle; wood-smoke arose,
swarthy over the heat, the roaring flame
woven with weeping --the tumult of winds lay still--
until it the bone-house had broken
hot at heart; despairing in their hearts
they bemoaned their grief, their liege-lord's death;
so too a death-dirge a solitary Geatish woman wove for Beowulf, cruelly bound,
she sang sorrowful, earnestly of fortune
that she for herself days of harm fiercely dreaded,
of multitude of slaughter-feasts, terror of troops,
rapine and bondage. Heaven swallowed the smoke;
then wrought the Wederas' people
a barrow on the hill, it was high and broad,
for wave-farers widely visible,
and they constructed in ten days
the war-chief's beacon, the leavings of the fire,
with a wall they encircled, as it most worthily
the very wisest men could devise;
they placed in the barrow rings and brooches,
all such trappings, as before from the hoard
hostile men had taken away;
the treasure of heroes they let the earth hold,
gold in the gritty soil, where it now still lives,
as useless to men as it was before.
Then around the mound rode the battle-brave
sons of nobles, twelve in all,
they wished to bewail their sorrow, to mourn their king,
to pronounce elegy, and speak about the man;
they praised his heroic deeds and his works of courage,
exalted his majesty. As it is fitting,
that one his friend and lord honours in words,
cherish in one's spirit, when he must forth
from his body be led;
thus bemourned the people of the Geats their lord's fall, his hearth-companions:
they said that he was, of all kings of the world,
the most generous of men, and the most gracious,
the most protective of his people, and the most eager for honour.
