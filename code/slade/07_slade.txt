sail fastened by rope; the sea-beam thundered;
there the wave-floater was not by wind over the waves
hindered in its venture; the sea-goers went,
the foamy-necked floated forth over the waves,
bound prow over the ocean-streams,
until they the Geatish cliffs could perceive,
the well-known headlands; the keel rushed up
weather-beaten, rested on the land.
Quickly was at the water the ready harbour-guard,
he who already for a long time for the beloved men
eager at the current gazed far;
moored in the sand the broad-bosomed ship
firm with anchor-bounds, lest the force of the waves
the winsome timbers might carry away;
he ordered then to carry up the nobles' treasure,
trappings and gold ornaments; it was not far thence for them
to seek the giver of treasures
Hygelac son of Hrethel, where he dwelt at home
himself with his companions near the sea-wall.
The building was splendid, the king of princely valour,
the high hall, Hygd very young,
wise, well-thriving, through few winters
in the walled town had lived,
Haereth's daughter was not mean though
nor too grudging of gifts to the people of the Geats,
of treasure-wealth. She showed violent arrogance,
the lusty queen of the folk, terrible crimes;
dared not any of the bold to risk,
of the dear companions, except her great lord,
that on her by day stared with his eyes
but for him slaughter-bonds he might consider prescribed,
woven by hands; quickly then was
after seizure a maiche was appointed,
that it, shadow-marked, was obliged to settle,
make known the evil of the death; such queenly manner is not
for a lady to perform, though she be matchless,
that peace-weaver deprives life,
owing to a false injury, of beloved man.
However, it was cut off at the heel by Hemming's kinsman;
the ale-drinkers further told
that evil for the people she practised less,
malice and enmity, since she first was
given, gold-adorned, to the young champion,
of noble ancestry, when she to Offa's hall
over the dusky flood by her father's wisdom
sought in her journey where she afterwards fully
on the throne, for goodness famed,
the fated span of her life her living she used well,
held high-love for the heroes' lord,
of all mankind, I have heard,
the finest between the seas,
of the mighty race. Because Offa was
in gifts and in war, a spear-keen man;
widely honoured, ruled in wisdom
his homeland; then, exceedingly sad, he arose
a help to heroes, the kinsman of Hemming,
grandson of Garmund, powerful over strife.
Then the hardy man went with his hand-picked retinue
himself along the sand treading the sea-plain,
the wide strand; the world-candle shone,
the sun eagerly from the south; they had survived the journey,
strode quickly, to where the Shield of Heroes,
--the bane of Ongentheow-- inside his citadel,
the young war-king, they heard that there the good man
alloted rings. To Hygelac was
Beowulf's journey promptly reported,
that there in enclosed homestead, the defender of warriors,
shield-companion still living came,
from the war-play unharmed going to to the court;
quickly was cleared, as the king bade,
for the visitors on foot the floor within;
then he sat down with the same man, he who had survived the fight,
kinsman with kinsman, after the liege-lord
through ceremonious speech his loyal subject had greeted,
in emphatic words, mead-draughts
passed round through that spacious room Haereth's daughter,
--she loved the people-- bore goblets
to the hands of the illustrious ones. Hygelac began
his hall-companion in that high hall
to question courteously, his curiosity burst forth,
whatever the Sea-Geats' adventures were:
'How fared you on the way, dear Beowulf,
when you suddenly resolved far away
to seek conflict over the salt water,
combat in Heorot? Moreover, did you Hrothgar's
widely known woes at all ameliorate,
for the famed chieftain? I of this with anxious care of the heart
seethed with wellings of sorrow, I did not trust the venture
of my dear man; I begged you at length,
that you the slaughter-ghast would not challenge at all,
let the South-Danes settle themselves
the war with Grendel; to God I speak thanks,
for that I you sound am permitted to see.'
Beowulf spoke, the son of Edgetheow:
'It is not secret, lord Hygelac,
that great meeting, to many men,
what a time of struggle between the two of us, me and Grendel,
occurred in that place where he great multitudes
for the Victory-Scyldings brought about sorrows,
lifelong misery; I avenged it all,
thus there is need to boast --of Grendel's kinsmen,
evil upon the earth-- of that clash at dawn,
he who lives the longest of that hateful race,
enveloped in malice. I first came there
to that ring-hall to greet Hrothgar;
straightaway to me the famed kinsman of Half-Dane,
after he the purpose of the heart of mine knew,
with his own sons he appointed a seat;
The troop was joyful; I have not seen in my whole life
under heaven's vault a hall-sitters'
mead-revelry greater. At times the renowned queen,
the peace-pledge of peoples, passed over all of the floor,
urged on the young boys; often twisted-rings she
gave to the warriors, before she went to her seat;
from time to time before the band of experienced warriors Hrothgar's daughter
to nobles continuously to the end bore the ale-flagon,
those I Freawaru the ones on the floor
I heard name her, when she the studded cup
gave to heroes, she is promised, young, gold-adorned, to gracious son of Froda;
this has arranged the Friend of the Scyldings,
the kingdom's shepherd, and counsel reckons it
that he with this woman a great part of the slaughter-feuds,
conflicts will settle. Very seldom anywhere
after the fall of a leader even a little while
the murderous spear bends down, though the bride be good.
This then may displease the chief of the Heatho-Bards'
and every thane of that people,
when he with the maiden walks on the floor:
that the noble sons of the Danes, her veteran troop, are entertained,
on them glisten ancient heirlooms,
hard and ring-adorned, the Heatho-Bards' treasure,
so long as they those weapons were able to wield.
Until they had led to disaster in the shield-play
their dear companions and their own lives.
Then speaks at the beer-drinking, he who sees a ring-precious object,
the old ash-warrior, he who remembers all
the spear-death of men --in him is a fierce heart--
he begins sad-spirited in a young champion,
by the musing of his heart, to tempt his mind,
to awaken war-horror, and speaks these words:
"Can you, my friend, recognise that maiche,
which your father bore into the fight,
under his army-mask on the last campaign,
precious iron, there the Danes slew him,
controlled the slaying-field, when retribution failed,
after the heroes' fall, the fierce Scyldings?
Now here of those slayers the son of one or other of them,
exultant in trappings, goes across the floor,
boasts of murder, and wears the treasure
which you by right ought to possess."
Thus he incites and reminds every time
with grievous words, until that time comes
that the woman's thane for his father's deeds
from the bite of a bill-blade sleeps, stained in blood,
having forfeited life; him the other thence
escapes alive, the land is readily known to him.
Then are broken on both sides
the sworn oaths of earls; then in Ingeld
murderous hate will well up and in him the love of woman
surges of grief will become cooler;
Therefore I the Heathobards' loyalty do not consider,
the alliance's portion, for the Danes untreacherous,
enduring friendship. I ought speak further
again about Grendel, that you may readily know,
giver of treasure, what then happened,
the hand-fight of heroes when heaven's gem
had glided over the earth, the ireful guest came,
terrible, fierce in the evening to visit us,
where we, unharmed, warded the hall,
where was for Hondscio a sinking battle
deadly evil for the doomed man; he fell first,
the girded champion; for him Grendel was,
the famed thane of distinction, a slayer by mouth,
the belovèd man's body swallowed up completely;
not the sooner out yet empty-handed,
the slayer bloody-toothed, wickedness in mind,
from the gold-hall did he wish to go
but he, famed for his strength, tested me,
gripped with an eager hand; a pouch hung down
spacious and strange, with cleverly-wrought clasps held fast,
it was cunningly all devised
with devil's crafts and dragon's skins;
he me there inside, guiltless,
the daring instigator wished to stuff,
as one of many; he could not do so,
since I in anger stood erect.
It is too long to recount how I the scourge of the people
for each of his evils paid in hand-requital
where I, my lord, your people
honoured by acts; he escaped away
for a little while, enjoyed the joy of life;
yet from him the right, a vestige, remained behind
hand in Heorot, and he wretched thence,
gloomy in his heart, sank into the depths of the mere.
To me for the bloody battle the Friend of the Scyldings
with objects of plated gold in plenty rewarded,
many treasures, when morning came,
and we to the feast had sat down
where was song and glee: old Scylding
who has heard tell of many things, from long ago narrated;
at times this battle-daring one the harp for pleasure
the old-wood played; sometimes recited a song,
true and tragic; sometimes strange tales
he related rightly, the open-hearted king;
at times he began again, bound in his age,
the ancient war-soldier, to mourn for his youth,
his battle-strength; his heart welled inside,
when he, wise in winter, recalled many things.
So we there inside a whole long day
took pleasure, until came night
another to men; then was again swiftly
ready for grief-revenge Grendel's mother,
she journeyed full of sorrow; Death had taken her son,
the war-hate of the Wederas; the horrible woman
avenged her child, killed a warrior
savagely; there was from Æschere,
the old, wise lore-counsellor, life departed.
Nor could they him, when morning came,
weary of death the Danish people
cremate in fire, nor lay on the funeral bale,
the beloved man; she had carried off the corpse
in fiend's embrace beneath the mountain stream;
that was for Hrothgar the most bitter grief
which the ruler of the people long had received.
Then me the chieftain, by your life,
implored with troubled mind, that I in the waters' tumult
perform a noble act, risk life,
accomplish glory; he promised me rewards.
Then I the welling waters', as is widely known,
wrathful ghastly guard of the deep found;
there a while we were sharing a hand;
the water welled with gore, and I cut off the head
in that deep-hall of Grendel's mother
with mighty edges, not easily thence
I carried off my life; I was not doomed yet
but to me the protector of heroes again gave
many treasures, the kinsman of Half-Dane.'
So the king of the people lived according to proper custom;
I by no means the gifts had lost,
strength's reward, but he gave me treasures,
the son of Half-Dane, according to my own glory,
these I to thee, warrior-king, wish to bring,
graciously to offer; still is all in thee
dependent upon your favour; I have few
near kinsmen except you Hygelac.'
Then he commanded to be brought in the boar-crested standard,
the battle-steep helm, hoar-silver byrnie,
the beautiful war-sword; the tale thereafter uttered:
'To me this battle-equipment Hrothgar gave,
the clever ruler; with some words he ordered,
that I first you its legacy relate;
he said it owned King Heorogar,
the leader of the Scyldings a long time;
no sooner for that to his son did he wish to give,
to bold Heoroweard, though he was loyal to him,
the breast-armour. Use it all well.'
I heard that with the treasure four mares
swift, all alike, followed behind,
apple-yellow; he to him offered the gifts,
horses and riches. So should a kinsman act:
not at all malice-nets weave for others,
with hidden arts contrive death
of hand-companions. To Hygelac was
in fierce strife his nephew very loyal,
and each the other's benefit remembered;
I heard that he the neck-ring gave to Hygd,
the exquisite marvel-jewel, which Wealhtheow gave him,
chieftain's daughter, three horses also
supple and bright with saddles; then was her,
after receiving the ring, breast adorned.
Thus he was bold, the son of Edgetheow,
man famed in war, for good deeds;
he led his life for glory, never, having drunk, slew
his hearth-companions; a troubled heart was not in him,
but he mankind's greatest strength,
--that ample gift, which God gave him--
he held, battle-daring. Long had he been abject
so the sons of the Geats did not reckon him good,
nor to him on the mead-bench much honour
the commander of the troops would grant;
they especially said, that he was slack,
no bold noble; a turn-around came
to the glory-blessed man for each of these miseries.
Then the protector of heroes ordered to be fetched in,
the war-noble king, Hrethel's heirloom,
fitted out in gold; there was not among the Geats then
a better precious treasure in the manner of a sword;
that he in Beowulf's lap layed,
and gave him seven thousand hides of land,
residence and ruler's seat. Theirs was both together
in that nation inherited land,
earth by ancestral privelege, to the second more
of that broad kingdom to him who was higher.
After that it came to pass in later days
in battle-clashes, when Hygelac lay dead,
and for Heardred battle-maiches,
under the cover of his shield, became the instruments of his death,
when they sought him out in the victory-tribe,
the fierce battle-ready warriors, the Battle-Scilfings,
with enmity they attacked the nephew of Hereric;
thereupon to Beowulf the broad kingdom
passed into his hands; he ruled well
for fifty winters --then he was a wise king,
an old warden of the fatherland-- until one began
in the dark nights, a dragon to rule,
he who in a high house watched over a hoard,
a stark stone barrow; the path below lay
unknown to men. There went inside
a man, I know not which, and he groped near
the heathen hoard, his hands wrapped round
an ornamented bauble, he got that afterwards;
though he who sleeping had been tricked
by thief's cunning; the people discovered that,
the neighbouring folk of men, that he was enraged.
He was not at all in control of the skill of the worm-hoard,
