by deeds ensured, that your fame lives
for ever and ever; may the All-Ruler you
reward with good, as He has now yet done!'
Beowulf spoke, the son of Edgetheow:
'We the courage-works with great pleasure,
endeavoured to fight, boldly risked
the strength of an unknown foe. I would rather
that you him himself might have seen,
the fiend in his full gear wearied by death;
I him quickly in hard clasp
on the bed of slaughter thought to fetter,
that he because of the hand-grip of mine must
lie struggling for life, lest his body slip away;
I him could not, when the Measurer of Fate did not wish it,
hinder departing; nor I so readily kept him close,
that mortal foe; he was too overpowering,
the fiend in departing; however, he left his hand
to save his life, remaining behind,
arm and shoulder; not with it though any
the worthless creature, relief purchased;
not the longer does he live, the hateful spoiler,
struck down by sins but him the wound has
with violent grip narrowly enclosed
in baleful bonds, there he must await,
the creature stained with crimes, the great judgement,
how him the glorious Measure of Fate wishes to decree.'
Then the man was more silent, the son of Edgelaf,
in boast-speech of war-works
when the noble men, by the strength of the prince
over the high roof saw the hand,
the fiend's fingers; on the front of each was,
in the place of each nail very much like steel
heathenish hand-spurs, the war-creature's
ungentle talon; everyone said
that him no hard weapon would strike,
pre-eminent iron, that of them none the demon's
bloody battle-hand would injure.
Then the order was promptly given the interior of Heorot
to furnish by hands; many there were,
of men and women, who the wine-hall,
the guest-hall prepared; gold-glittering shone
woven tapestries along the walls, many wondrous sights
for each of the men, who on such stared;
that bright building was badly broken up
all inside secure with iron-bands,
hinges sprung open; the roof alone remained
entirely sound, when the ogre,
guilty of wicked deeds turned in flight,
despairing of life. That is not easy
to flee from --try he who will--
but he must gain by strife, those who have souls,
compelled by necessity, the mens' sons',
the ground-dwellers' ready place,
there his body, fast in his death-bed,
sleeps after feasting. Then it was the time and occasion
that to the hall went Half-Dane's son;
the king himself wished to partake of the feast;
I have not heard when a tribe in a greater force
around their treasure-giver comported themselves better;
they then sank down on the bench, the fame-bearers,
rejoicing at the feast; they graciously received
many full goblets of mead, their kinsmen,
stout-hearted, in the high hall
Hrothgar and Hrothulf· the interior of Heorot was
filled with friends; no treacherous-strokes
the Folk-Scyldings made as yet.
Then Beowulf was given the brand of Half-Dane,
the golden banner in reward of victory,
the adorned standard, helm and byrnie;
the renowned treasure-sword many saw
brought before the hero; Beowulf took
the full flagon from the floor; of the reward-gift he did not,
as payment, need to be ashamed;
I have not heard that more graciously four treasures,
adorned with gold, many men
on ale-bench have given to others;
around the helmet's roof --the head-guard--
was wound with wires the re-inforced crest guarded from without,
that him what the files have left could not savagely,
could not harm the wondrously-tempered helm, when the shield-fighter
against enemies had to go.
The defender of earls then ordered eight horses,
with decorated head-gear, led onto the hall-floor
in under the ramparts; one of them stood,
saddle skilfully adorned, ennobled with jewels;
that was the battle-seat of the high king,
when in sword-play the son of Half-Dane
wished to engage; in the vanguard it never failed
his warskill well-known, when the slain were falling;
and then to Beowulf both of the treasures
the protector of the Friends of Ing bestowed possession,
horses and weapons; he ordered him to make good use of them;
so in a manly manner the famed chieftain,
the hoard-ward of heroes, paid for war-clashes
in horses and treasures; thus, one can never find fault in them
he who wishes to tell the truth according to what is right.
Then, furthermore, to each one of the earl's company
those with Beowulf travelled the sea-path,
on the mead-bench he gave treasures,
inherited relics, and the one man decreed
to requite in gold whom Grendel first
in wickedness quelled, as he would have more of them
except for them wise God that fate had prevented,
and this man's courage. The Measure of Fate controlled all
for mankind, as he now still does;
therefore understanding is best everywhere,
the forethought of mind; he must abide much
love and much hate he who long here
in these days of strife would enjoy the world.
There was song and sound at the same time all together
before Half-Dane's battle-plotter,
the glee-wood plucked, a lay often recited
when a hall-performance Hrothgar's bard before the mead-bench was obliged to utter:
concerning Finn's heirs, with whom, when disaster struck them,
the hero of Half-Danes, Hnaef the Scylding,
on the Frisian battle-field was fated to fall.
Truly, Hildeburh did not have need to praise
the good faith of the Eotens; she was guiltless,
bereft of her dear ones: --in the war-play--
her son and brother; they fell, in accorance with Fate,
wounded by spear; that was a mournful woman.
Not without reason did Hoc's daughter
grieve over Fate's decree, when the morning came,
then she under the sky could see
the baleful slaughter of kinsmen, where before he had held the most
joy in the world, war took all
of Finn's thanes, except a few alone,
so that he could not in that meeting-place
the clash with Hengest conclude at all,
nor the woeful remnant by battle dislodge from their position,
the prince's thane, so they offered them settlement:
that they for them the other dwelling would completely clear,
hall and high seat, that they would half of it control
with the Eotens' sons might have,
and at the giving of treasure Folcwalden's son
each day the Danes would honour,
Hengest's company would revere with rings,
with even as much precious possesions
of ornate gold exactly as he the Frisian kind
in the beer-hall would wish to embolden.
Then they pledged on both sides
firm compact of peace; Finn to Hengest
with incontestable earnestness proclaimed an oath
that he the woeful remnant, by sages' judgement,
would hold in honour, that there any man
by word nor by deed would not break the treaty,
nor in malicious artifice ever complain,
though they their ring-giver's killer followed,
leaderless, and were thus forced by necessity;
if then any Frisian by audacious speech
the murderous feud were to remind them,
then it by sword's edge must be thereafter.
The funeral fire was prepared, and Ingui's gold,
raised from the hoard; the War-Scyldings'
best battle-man was ready on the bier;
at the funeral-pyre was easily seen
the blood-stained mail-shirt, the swine all-golden,
the boar hard as iron, the prince had many
destroyed by wounds; great men had fallen in slaughter;
then Hildeburh ordered at Hnaef's pier
her own son committed to the fire,
the body-vessel burned, and put on the bier,
the wretched woman at his shoulder, the lady lamented,
sorrowed with songs; the warrior was laid out,
spiralled into the clouds the greatest fire of the slain
roared before the mound; heads melted,
the wound-gates burst open, then blood sprang out,
from the hate-bites of the body; the blaze swallowed all up,
--the greediest guest-- those who there were taken by battle
from both peoples; their vigour was dispersed.
The warriors returned then to seek their houses,
bereft of friends, to see Frisia,
their homes and high fort; yet Hengest
the death-stained winter spent with Finn,
in a place with no fellowship at all; he remembered his land,
though he could not drive on the sea
the ring-prowed ship: the sea welled in storm,
fought against the wind; the winter locked the waves
in icy bonds, until came another
year to the courtyards, as it still does now,
those which continuously carry out their seasons,
gloriously bright weathers. Then winter was gone,
fair was the Earth's breast; the exile was anxious to go,
the guest of the dwellings; he of vengeance for grief
sooner thought than of sea-path,
and whether he a bitter encounter could bring about,
for that he of the Eotens' sons inwardly remembered;
so he did not refuse the worldly practice,
when to him Hunlafing the battle-light,
the finest blade he placed on Hnaef's lap;
among the Eotens its edges were known.
So too his mortal enemy's --Finn in turn received--
dire sword-onslaught in his own home,
when concerning the fierce attack Guthlaf and Oslaf,
following their sea-journey, declared their grief,
blamed for their share of woes; he could not his restless spirit
contain in his breast; then the hall were decorated
with the foes' lives, so too Finn was slain,
the king amid his troop, and the queen was seized;
Scylding shooters ferried to the ships
all of the house-goods of the nation's king,
which they at Finn's estate could find:
shining jewels and well-cut gems; they on the sea-path
the noble lady ferried to the Danes,
led to the people. The lay was sung,
the gleeman's tale; joy again sprang up,
music rang out from the bench, cup-bearers served
wine from wondrous vessels. Then Wealhtheow came forth,
walking in a golden neck-ring to where the good pair
sat, uncle and nephew; then their kinship was still together,
each to the other true; Unferth the þyle was also there
sitting at the feet of the Scylding lord; each of them trusted his spirit,
and that he had great courage, though he to his kin was not
honourable in clash of blades; the Scylding lady then spoke:
'Receive this full cup, my noble lord,
dispenser of treasure; you--be joyful,
gold-friend of men, and to the Geats speak
with gentle words so ought a man to do;
be gracious with the Geats, mindful of gifts
which from near and far you now have;
it has been said to me that you wish for a son,
to have this leader of armies; Heorot is cleansed,
the bright ring-hall; enjoy, while you may, many rewards, and leave to your kinsmen
folk and kingdom when you must go forth
to meet what is fated; I know my
gracious Hrothulf, that he the youths wishes
to hold in honour, if you earlier than he,
friend of the Scyldings, leave behind the world,
I think that he with good will repay
our children, if he that at all remembers,
what we for his sake and for his worldly renown,
before, in his youth, bestowed our favours.'
She turned then by the bench, where her boys were,
Hrethric and Hrothmund, and heroes' sons,
the young company all together; there sat the good
Beowulf of the Geats by the two brothers.
The full cup was brought to him, and a friendly invitation
proffered in words, and twisted gold
kindly offered: two arm-ornaments,
robe and rings, the largest necklace
of those which I on earth have heard of;
none under the sky I have heard of better
from hoard-treasures of heroes, since Hama carried off
to the battle-bright stronghold the Brosings' necklet,
jewel and precious setting; he fled the cunning enmity
of Eormenric, chose eternal benefit;
That ring had Hygelac of the Geats, grandson of Swerting, on his last adventure,
when under the banner he defended riches,
warded slaughter-spoils; him Fate took away,
after he from pride sought misery,
feud with the Frisians; he then wore the ornament,
the mysterious stone over the waves' cup,
the mighty prince; he fell under the rimmed-shield.
Passed then into the Franks' grasp the body of the king,
mail-coat and the ring together;
lesser warrior rifled the corpses
after the slaughter of battle; the people of the Geats
filled the field of corpses. The hall resounded with noise;
Wealhtheow spoke; she spoke before the retinue:
'Make use of this ring, belovèd Beowulf,
young man, with good fortune, and take benefit from this corslet,
the wealth of a nation, and prosper well,
prove yourself with strength, and to these lads be
gentle in teaching; I shall remember you for this requital;
you have brought it about that you far and near
always and forever men will praise,
even as widely as the sea surrounds
the home of the wind, walls; be while you live,
prince, happy; I wish thee well,
and rich in treasure; be you to my sons
indulgent in deeds, possessing joy;
here is each of the men true to the others
generous in mind, in the protetion of their liege-lord;
the thanes are united, the people alert,
the warrior-retinue cheered by drink do as I bid.'
She went then to her seat; there was the finest feast,
the men drank wine; they did not know their fate,
horrific destiny, as it had happened
to many heroes, after evening came,
and Hrothgar went to his quarters,
the ruler to rest, the hall guarded
countless earls, as they often had done before,
they cleared away the benches from the floor; over it was spread
bedding and bolsters; one of the beer-drinkers,
eager and doomed, lay down in his hall-couch;
they set at their heads battle-bossed shields,
bright linden-wood; there on the bench was
over each nobleman easily seen
a battle-steep helm, ringed byrnie,
and glorious mighty shaft; their custom was
that they were often ready for a battle
both at home and out harrying, and either of these,
for just such times as for their liege-lord
the need arose; they were a good platoon.
They sank then into sleep; one paid sorely
for his evening rest, as had quite often happened,
when the gold-hall Grendel warded,
inflict wrong until the end came,
death for crimes. That became manifest,
widely known by men, that an avenger still
lived after the misfortunes, for a long time
after the war-trouble, Grendel's mother,
lady troll-wife, remembered misery,
she who the dreadful water had to inhabit,
the cold currents, after strife arose through him,
a sword-slayer to an only brother,
father's kin; he went then stained,
marked by the murder, fled human pleasures,
lived in the wilds. Then awoke many
fated spirits; Grendel was one of these,
the hateful sword-outlaw, who found at Heorot
a watching man biding for battle;
there with him the troll came at close grips;
yet he remembered the great strength,
generous gift, which God gave him,
