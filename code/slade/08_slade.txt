of his own desire, he who sorely injured him,
because of dire-distress a thief of I know not which
sons of men fled hostile blows,
in need of a hall and there within raged,
a man haunted by guilt, immediately watched over;
then against the stranger stood horror and terror;
nevertheless upon the wicked one poured peril.
He sought treasure-gold, there was many such,
in that earth-hall, ancient treasures,
as they in former days some man,
this great legacy of a noble kind,
full of thought, had hid there
these dear treasures; all of them Death took
in earlier times, and then were yet one
of the old warriors of that people, the one who moved about there longest,
the friend-grieving warden, he hoped to delay that much,
so that he for a little while the long-kept treasure
would be able to enjoy. The barrow all-ready
occupied the plain near the water-waves,
new on the headland, made secure by difficult-craft;
there inside bore of the treasure of earls
a hoard of rings a hand-fashioned share
of plated gold; some words he spoke:
'Now hold you, Earth, now the heroes cannot
earls' possessions. Listen, it formerly from you
was obtained by good men; war-death has taken away,
terrible murder of life, of crimes each one,
my belovèd people, they gave this up to me:
they had seen joy in the hall; he I have not, who might wield sword
or make beautiful this gilded flagon,
this precious drinking vessel; the veteran warriors are ill elsewhere;
must the stern helmet adorned with gold
stripped of its ornaments; the burnishers slumbers,
they who war-masks ought to brighten;
also so the army's coats of mail, which in battle endured
over the shattering of shield-boards the bite of iron,
decay along with the men; byrnie's ring may not
with war-fighter fare widely,
alongside heroes; there was not harp's joy,
delight of glee-wood, nor good hawk
soaring through the hall, nor swift horse
trampling the courtyard; baleful death has
many of my living kin sent forth.'
Thus sad at heart in grief he bemoaned
one after all, unhappily passed
days and nights, until the flood of Death
reached to his heart. Hoard-joy he found,
the old twilight-scather, standing open,
he who, burning, seeks barrows,
the naked malevolent dragon; he flies by night,
encircled in fire; him earth-dwellers
He has to seek
harm in the ground, where he heathen gold
guards, wise in winters; he is not a bit better for that.
So the people-scather three hundred winters
ruled in the earth of one of the hoard-halls,
vastly powerful, until one angered him,
a man in pride: he bore to his liege-lord
the gold-adorned cup, begged peace-truce
from his lord; then was the hoard ransacked,
rings' hoard borne off, a boon was granted
to the wretched man; a lord examined
the ancient work of men for the first time.
then the worm awoke, --quarrel was renewed--
he sniffed along the stone, the harsh-hearted one found
the foot-print of his foe; he too far forward had stepped
in his stealthy craft near the dragon's head.
Provided that, one not doomed may easily survive
woe and hardship, he who the Ruler's
grace protects. The hoard-ward sought
eagerly along the ground, he wished to find the man,
the one who him in his slumber had sorely harmed;
hot and fierce-minded, he often circled among the mounds
all round the outside --not any man there
in that wilderness, but he rejoiced in battle,
of battle-work --sometimes he turned back to the barrow,
sought the treasure-cup; he suddenly discovered,
that a certain man had disturbed the gold,
the high treasures; the hoard-ward waited
with great difficulty, until evening came;
then was enraged the keeper of the barrow,
he wished the injury to repay with flame,
the dear drinking-vessel. Then the day was departed
to the joy of the wyrm; he did not lie within the wall,
nor wished to wait, but with bale-fire set forth,
infused with flame; this beginning was terrible
for the people in the land, as it soon was
upon their treasure-giver painfully ended.
Then the demon began to spew flames,
to burn bright houses; the gleam of fire rose
to the horror of the men; nor there anything alive
the hateful air-flier wished to leave;
the war-strength of that wyrm was widely seen,
the malice of the darkly cunning one near and far,
how the war-scather the people of the Geats
hated and humiliated; back to his hoard he shot,
the hidden lord-hall ere the time of day;
the inhabitants of the land had been seized by flame,
in blaze and in fire; his barrow he trusted,
his war-skill and his walls; him this belief deceived.
Then was to Beowulf the danger made known
quickly in truth, that his own home,
the finest of dwellings, in waves of heat melted,
the throne of the Geats; that was to the good man
a grief in his heart, of the mind-sorrows the greatest;
the wise man thought that he the Ruler
against ancient law eternal Lord
had bitterly angered; inside his breast welled
with thoughts of gloom, such was not usual for him.
The fire-drake had the fortress of the people,
by the coast-land, the stronghold
ground down with flames; him for that the war-king,
the chief of the Wederas, studied vengeance;
then he ordered to be made for him, a warriors' protector,
all of iron, the lord of earls,
a wonderous war-board; he readily knew,
that him tree-wood could not help,
linden-wood against fire. He had to his seafaring-days,
the old, good noble, abide the end
of life in the world, and the wyrm together,
though the hoard-wealth he had held long.
Then he scorned, the rings' lord,
that he the wide-flier would seek out with a troop,
a large army; he did not the strife dread for himself,
nor him the wyrm's fire esteem a bit,
power and courage, for that he before many,
narrowly risking, hostilities survived,
battle-clashes, since he Hrothgar's,
--victory-favoured man-- hall cleansed,
and in war overwhelmed Grendel's race,
hateful kind. Not the least was the hand-to-hand encounter, where one slew Hygelac,
after the Geats' king, in war's rushes,
the lord and friend of the folk, in Frisia,
Hrethel's heir, died in the drink of sword,
beaten down by bill-blades. Then Beowulf came
by his own strength, he made use of the sea;
he had in his arms thirty warriors'
battle-gear, when he mounted the ocean;
not at all did the Hetwares had need to be exulting
over the fighting on foot, who forth against him
bore linden-wood shields; few came back
from that warrior to visit their homes.
He crossed over then the flowing expanse of waters, the son of of Edgetheow,
wretched and solitary, back to the people,
there Hygd bade him hoard and kingdom,
rings and throne: in her son she did not trust
that he against foreign peoples the ancestral throne
had the power to hold when Hygelac was dead;
not the sooner the destitute ones could find
in the noble one by any means,
that he to Heardred would be a lord,
or the kingdom wished to accept;
yet he to him among the folk upheld with the counsels of a friend,
graciously in honour, until he grew older,
ruled the Weder-Geats. Him banished men
from across the sea sought, sons of Ohthere;
they had rebelled against the Helm of the Scylfings,
the finest of sea-kings
who there in Sweden dispensed treasure,
famed chieftain; to him it became the end;
there he for his hospitality received a mortal-wound,
from sword's swing, the son of Hygelac;
and he went back, Ongentheow's son
to seek his home, after Heardred lay dead;
the throne he let Beowulf hold,
to rule the Geats; that was a good king.
He for the prince's fall requital remembered
in later days, to Eadgils he became
a friend in his plight; with men he supported
over the wide sea the son of Ohtere,
with warriors and weapons; he had vengeance then
in cold grief-bringing ventures, he deprived the king of his life:
so he each of the enmities had survived,
dire conflicts, the son of Ecgetheow,
deeds of courage, until the one day,
when he with the serpent must struggle.
Then he went, one of twelve, swollen with anger,
the lord of the Geats, to behold the dragon;
he had heard then whence this feud arose,
wicked hostility for men: to his bosom came
the precious vessel, through the informer's hand;
he was in that group the thirteenth man,
he who this strife's origin brought about,
the gloomy-minded captive; he was obliged, humbly, thence
to lead the way to the place; he went against his will
to where the earth-hall he alone knew,
the cairn under the ground near the surging of the sea,
the struggle of the waves; it was full inside
of jewels and intricate metal-work; an unpleasant guard,
ready, eager war-fighter held golden treasures
old under the earth; that was not an easy bargain,
to obtain for any man.
Then on the headland sat the violence-hard king,
while prosperity bid to his hearth-companions,
the gold-friend of the Geats; in him his heart was sad,
restless and slaughter-eager, fate all too near
which the old man must greet,
seeking the treasure of his soul, sever asunder
life from limb; it was not for long then
the nobleman's life would be wound in his flesh.
Beowulf spoke, the son of Edgetheow:
'In youth I many war-storms survived,
in battle-times; I remember all of that;
I was seven-winters old when me the lord of treasure,
the lord and friend of the folk, took from my father;
held and had me King Hrethel,
gave me treasure and feast, recalled kinship;
I was not by him in life less in aught,
a man in citadel, than each of his own sons,
Herebeald and Haethcyn or my Hygelac.
For the eldest was, unfittingly, by a kinsman's deeds a death-bed strewed,
when him Haethcyn from a horn-bow
his friend and lord struck down with an arrow,
missed his mark and his kinsman shot dead,
the one brother the other with a bloody bolt;
that was an irreparable fight, grieviously wronged,
heart-wearying in the breast; yet must though
the noble unavenged be parted from life.
In the same way it is tragic for an old man
to abide that his son rides
young on the gallows: then he utters a dirge,
a sorrowing song, that his son hangs
for the pleasure of the raven, and he can not him help,
old and experienced, any provide;
ever is reminded each morning,
of the other-world journey of his son; another he heeds not
to wait for within the strongholds,
guardian of inheritance, when the one he has
through Death's compulsion experienced deeds;
he sees, sad and sorrowful, in his son's dwelling
a wine-hall wasted, a wind-swept resting place
bereft of joy; the riders sleep,
heroes hidden in graves; there is not sound of harp,
revelry in the courts, such as long ago there was.
He goes then to his bed, sings a song of sorrow,
one man on account of one man; it seemed to him all too roomy,
the fields and the dwelling-place. Thus the Helm of the Wederas
on account of Herebeald heart's sorrow,
welling, endured: not a whit could he
on that life-slayer settle a feud;
nor the more for that warrior could he show hatred
with hostile acts, though he by him was not loved;
he then with that sorrow, which on him that sorely befell,
he gave over human joys, choose God's light;
to his heirs he left, as does a fortunate man,
the land and the folk-citadel, when he departed from life.
Then was injury and strife of the Swedes and the Geats
over the wide water a quarrel shared,
hard military-spite, after Hrethel died,
and to him Ongentheow's heirs were
vigorous and martial; they did not wish friendship
to hold across the ocean, but around Hreosnabeorh
horrible, malicious raiding often committed
that kin-friends of mine avenged,
feud and crime, as it was famous,
though one of the two with his life paid,
a hard bargain; for Hæthcyn was,
the Geats' lord, war impending.
Then I heard in the morning that one kinsman the other
with bill's edges took vengeance on the slayer,
there Ongentheow is attacked by Eofor;
the war-helm slipped asunder, the agèd Scylfing
fell battle-pale. The hand remembered
feuds a-plenty, did not withhold life-blow.
I to him the treasures, which he had given me,
repaid in war, as was granted to me,
with flashing sword; he gave me land,
earth, the joy of homeland; there was not for him any need,
that he among the Gifthas or the Spear-Danes
or in the Swedish Kingdom needed to seek
a worse war-eager fighter, to buy with wealth:
always, in the foot-troop, I him wished to go before,
alone in the vanguard, and thus must I always
act in battle, while this sword endures
that which me, early and later, has often served,
since I, in front of the legions, of Daeghrefn was his slayer by hand, the champion of the Hugas;
in no way the precious ornaments to the Frisian king,
breast-adorning, was he able to bring,
but rather with his contingent fell the banner's keeper,
the noble in courage; blade's edge was not the killer
but my battle-grip on him his heart's beats,
his bone-house, broke. Now I must with bill's edge,
hand and hard sword fight for the hoard.'
Beowulf declared, spoke vow-words
for the last time: 'I have risked many
wars in my youth; yet I wish,
old, wise warden of the folk, to seek vendetta,
to earn renown, if me that wreaker of evil
from his earth-hall ventures out to greet.' He then saluted each of the men,
bold helm-bearers for the final time,
dear companions: 'I would not bear a sword,
a weapon against the wyrm, if I knew how
against the monster else I might
grapple for glory, as I did before with Grendel
but I there furious fire's heat expect,
fierce and poisonous; therefore I have on me
shield-board and byrnie; nor will I from the barrow's guard
flee a foot but for us it must
happen at the wall as Fate allots us,
the Creator of all men; I am bold in spirit
that I against the war-flier forbear from boast.
You, await here on the barrow, clad in byrnies,
warriors in war-gear, which better can
during the slaughter-clash survive wound
of the two of us; it is not your adventure,
nor in the power of men, save mine alone.'
He knew that against the beast he would deal out his strength,
achieve noble rank; 'I must with courage
gain the gold, or war takes,
terrible deadly wound, your lord.'
Then he arose by means of his shield, the bold warrior,
severe under his helm, he wore sword-shirt
under stone cliffs, trusted in the strength
of a single man; such is not the coward's way.
He saw then by the wall, he who a great number,
