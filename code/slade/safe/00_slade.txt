Listen! We --of the Spear-Danes      in the days of yore,
of those clan-kings--      heard of their glory.
how those nobles      performed courageous deeds.
Often Scyld, Scef's son,      from enemy hosts
from many peoples      seized mead-benches;
and terrorised the fearsome Heruli      after first he was
found helpless and destitute,      he then knew recompense for that:-
he waxed under the clouds,      throve in honours,
until to him each      of the bordering tribes
beyond the whale-road      had to submit,
and yield tribute:-      that was a good king!
To him an heir was      born then
young in the yards,      God sent him
to comfort the people;      He had seen the dire distress
that they suffered before,      leader-less
a long while;      them for that the Life-Lord,
Ruler of Glory,      granted honour on earth:
Beowulf Beaw was famed      --his renown spread wide--
Scyld's heir,      in Northern lands.
So ought a young man      by good deeds deserve,
and by fine treasure-gifts,      while in his father's keeping,
that him in old age      shall again stand by,
willing companions,      when war comes,
people serve him:      by glorious deeds must,
amongst his people, everywhere,      one prosper.
Then Scyld departed      at the destined time,
still in his full-strength, to fare      in the protection of the Lord Frea;
he they carried      to the sea's surf,
his dear comrades,      as he himself had bid,
when he yet wielded words,      that friend of the Scyldings,
beloved ruler of the land,      had ruled for a long time;
there at the harbour stood      with a ringed-prow,
icy and keen to sail,      a hero's vessel;
they then laid down      the beloved prince,
the giver of rings and treasure,      in the bosom of the boat,
the mighty by the mast;      many riches were there,
from far-off lands      ornate armour and baubles were brought;
I have not heard of a comelier      keel adorned
with weapons of battle      and war-dress,
bill-blades and byrnies;      there lay on his breast
many treasures,      which with him must,
in the power of the waves,      drift far off;
in no way had they upon him fewer      gifts bestowed
with the wealth of a nation,      than those did
who him in the beginning      had sent forth
alone upon the waves      being but a child;
yet then they set up      the standard of gold,
high over head;      they let the sea bear,
gave to the ocean,      in them were troubled hearts,
mourning minds;      men cannot
say for certain,      neither court-counsellors
nor heroes under heaven,      who received that cargo.
Then was in boroughs,      Beowulf the Scylding Beaw,
beloved king of the people      a long age
famed among the folk      --his father having gone elsewhere,
elder on earth--      until unto him in turn was born
high Half-Dane,      he ruled so long as he lived
old and battle-fierce,      the glad Scyldings;
to him four sons      in succession
woke in the world,      the leader of the legions:
Heorogar and Hrothgar      and good Halga;
I heard that Yrse      was Onela's queen,
the War-Scylfing's      belovèd embraced in bed.
Then was to Hrothgar      success in warcraft given,
honour in war,      so that his retainers
eagerly served him      until the young war-band grew
into a mighty battalion;      it came into his mind
that a hall-house,      he wished to command,
a grand mead-hall,      be built by men
which the sons of men      should hear of forever,
and there within      share out all
to young and old,      such as God gave him,
except the common land      and the lives of men;
Then, I heard, widely      was the work commissioned
from many peoples      throughout this middle-earth,
to furnish this hall of the folk.      For him in time it came to pass,
early, through the men,      that it was fully finished,
the best of royal halls;      he named it Heorot,
he whose words weight      had everywhere;
he did not lie when he boasted;      rings he dealt out,
riches at his feasts.      The hall towered,
high and horn-gabled;      it awaited the cruel surges
of hateful flames;      nor was the time yet nigh
that the furious edge-malice      of son-in-law and father-in-law,
arising from deadly enmity      would inevitably awaken.
Then the bold spirit,      impatiently
endured dreary time,      he who dwelt in darkness,
he that every day      heard noise of revelry
loud in the hall;      there was the harmony of the harp,
the sweet song of the poet;      he spoke who knew how	
the origin of men      to narrate from afar;
said he that the almighty one      wrought the earth,
that fair, sublime field      bounded by water;
set up triumphant      the sun and moon,
luminaries as lamps      for the land-dwellers
and adorned      the corners of the earth
with limbs and leaves;      life too He formed
for each of the species      which lives and moves.
So the lord's men      lived in joys,
happily,      until one began
to execute atrocities,      a fiend in hell;
this ghastly demon was      named Grendel,
infamous stalker in the marches,      he who held the moors,
fen and desolate strong-hold;      the land of marsh-monsters,
the wretched creature      ruled for a time
since him the Creator      had condemned
with the kin of Cain;      that killing avenged
the eternal Lord,      in which he slew Abel;
this feud he did not enjoy,      for He drove him far away,
the Ruler, for this crime,      from mankind;
thence unspeakable offspring      all awoke:
ogres and elves      and spirits from the underworld;
also giants,      who strove with God
for an interminable season;      He gave them their reward for that.
He then went to visit and see      --when night came--
the high house      how it, the Ring-Danes
after the beer-feast,      had occupied;
he found then therein      the nobles' company
slumbering after the feast;      they did not know sorrow,
misery of men;      that damned creature,
grim and greedy,      soon was ready,
savage and cruel      and from their rest seized
thirty thanes;      thence back he went
proud in plunder      to his home, faring
with the banquet of bodies      to seek his shelter.
Then was in the dark of dawn      before the day
Grendel's war-might      revealed to the men;
then it was after their feasting      they raised up lament
in a great morning-cry.      The mighty chieftain,
the prince, old and good,      sat in sorrow,
The great mighty one suffered,      anguish of thane-loss   oppressed him
when they the foe's      tracks beheld,
of the wicked ghoul;      that strife was too strong,
loathsome and lingering.      Nor was it a longer time
but after a single night      again he perpetuated
more brutal slaughter,      and it grieved him not,
violence and viciousness,      he was too entrenched in these.
Then was it easily found,      one who would somewhere else,
further away,      seek rest:
a bed among the bowers,      when it was made clear to him,
truly told,      by an unmistakable token
the enmity of the hall's occupier;      he held himself then
further and safer,      he who shunned that fiend.
Thus he ruled      and challenged justice,
one against all,      until empty stood
that finest of houses;      the time was long
--the space of twelve winters--      that bitter anguish endured
the friend, the shielder,      --every woe,   
immense miseries;      therefore to men became
to sons of men,      clearly known
in mournful ballads,      that Grendel had contended
long against Hrothgar,      sustained fierce enmity,
felony and feud,      for many seasons
continual strife;      he did not want peace
with any man      of the Danish contingent,
to desist in life-destruction,      to settle it with payment,
none of the counsellors      had any need to hope for
noble recompense      from the slayer's hands,
but the wretch      was persecuting
--the dark death-shade--      warriors old and young;
he lay in wait and set snares,      in the endless night he held
the misty moors;      men do not know
where such hellish enigmas      slink in their haunts.
Thus many offences      that foe of mankind,
that terrible lone traveller,      often committed,
hard humiliations;      he dwelt in Heorot,
the richly-adorned hall,      in the black nights
--by no means he the gift-throne      was compelled to approach respectfully,
the treasure, by the Maker,      nor did he feel love for it--
That was great misery      for the Friend of the Scyldings,
a breaking of his spirit.      Many often sat
the mighty at counsel;      pondered a plan,
what by strong-minded men      would be best,
against the sudden horror,      to do;
sometimes they pledged      at holy temples
sacred honouring,      in words bid
that them the demon-slayer      would offer succour
from the plight of the people;      such was their habit:
the hope of heathens;      on hell they pondered	
in the depths of their hearts;      the Creator they did not know,
the Judge of deeds,      they were not aware of the Lord God,
nor yet they the Helm of the Heavens      were able to honour,
Glory's Wielder.      Woe be to him who must,
through dire terror,      thrust his soul
into fire's embrace;      hope not for relief,
or to change at all;      well be he who may
after death-day      seek the Lord
and in his Father's arms      yearn towards Nirvana.
So then over the sorrow of the time      the son of Half-Dane
continually brooded;      the wise hero could not
turn away woe;      that strife was too strong,
hateful and enduring,      that on the people came
fearfully cruel, violent trouble,      the greatest night-evil.
That from home heard      Hygelac's thane,
a good man of the Geats,      of Grendel's deeds;
he was of mankind      of the greatest strength,
on that day      in this life,
noble and mighty;      he ordered them a wave-crosser
--a good one-- prepare;      he said: the war-king
over swan-road      he wished to seek,
that mighty clan-chief,      since he was in need of men;
that adventure him,      the clear-headed chaps,
very little begrudged      though he was dear to them,
they urged on the valiant-hearted one,      and observed the omens.
The worthy one had,      from the Geatish peoples,
chosen champions,      those who were the boldest he
could find;      fifteen together,
they sought the sea-wood,      he led the warriors,
that sea-skilled man,      to the boundary of the shore.
Time passed by;      the ship was on the waves,
the boat under the cliffs;      the ready warriors
stepped up into the prow      --the currents curled round,
sea against sand--      the men bore
into the bosom of boat      bright arms and armour,
noble war-gear;      the fellows shoved off,
men on a welcome voyage,      in a well-braced ship.
Then they went over the water-waves      urged by the wind,
the foamy-necked floater,      remarkably bird-like
until in due time,      on the second day,
the curved-prow      had made the journey,
so that the sailors      sighted land,
bright sea-cliffs,      towering shores,
wide headlands;      then was the sea traversed,
their sea-voyage at an end.      Thence up quickly
the Wederas-warriors      stepped onto land;
moored their vessel;      their mail-shirts clanked
those war-garments;      they thanked God
that for them the wave-paths      had been smooth.
Then from the wall saw      the ward of the Scyldings,
he who the sea-cliffs      had the duty to guard,
borne over the gang-plank,      bright bossed-shields,
eager war-devices;      in him curiosity broke
the thoughts of his heart:      what these men were;
then he went to the shore      riding his horse,
the thane of Hrothgar;      he forcefully shook
his mighty wooden shaft,      and with formal words asked:
'What are you      armour-wearers
bound in byrnies,      who thus your tall keel
over the sea-street      leading came,
hither over the waters?'
He was the coast-guardian,      he held the sea-watch,
so that on Danish land      no enemies at all
with a navy      would not be able to ravage.
'Not here more openly      began to come
lindenwood shield-bearers,      nor you the leave-word
of our war-makers      certainly don't know
our kinsmen's consent;      never have I seen greater
noble on earth      than the one that you are,
warrior in armour;      this is no mere retainer
made worthy by weapons;      unless he is belied by his looks,
a unique appearance!      Now I must your
lineage learn,      ere you far hence,
deceiving spies      in the land of the Danes
further fare;      now you far-dwellers
you sea-sailors,      hear my
one-fold thought:      speed is best
for reporting,      whence your comings are.'
He the eldest      answered,
the crew's captain,      he unlocked his word-hoard:
'We are of the tribe      of the Geat people
and Hygelac's      hearth-companions;
my father was      known to the folk,
a noble vanguard-warrior,      called Edgetheow,
who saw many winters      ere he passed away,
old, from our courtyards;      he is readily recalled
by each one of the wise      widely throughout the world.
We, by resolute resolve,      your lord,
the son of Half-Dane      have come to seek,
that protector of the people;      be you a good guide to us;
we have, to that grand one,      a great errand
to the Danish lord;      there shouldn't some secret
be of this, I think.      You know if it is
as we truly      have heard said,
that amongst the Scyldings,      some enemy, I know not what,
a furtive despoiler,      in dark nights,
sickeningly reveals      unknown enmity,
suffering and slaughter.      I can on this matter, to Hrothgar,
from a spacious spirit,      give counsel,
how he, wise and good,      overcome the fiend--
if for him a change      ever should,
from this suffering of miseries      to remedy, come after--
and his hot wellings of melancholic care      grow cooler;
or else ever after,      a time of torment,
horrible hardship he will endure,      so long as there remains,
in its high place,      that best of houses.
The guard made a speech,      sitting there on his horse,
--the unhesistating officer:      'He will --every
sharp shield-warrior--      know the distinction
between words and works,      he who reasons rightly.
I hear it,      that this is a legion loyal
to the lord of the Scyldings;      go forth bearing
weapons and armour;      I shall guide you;
likewise, I  the kin-thanes      of mine will order,
against any foes      your vessel,
--newly tarred,      ship on the sand--
to guard in honour,      until it bears back,
over the sea-streams,      the dear man,
--the swoop-necked wood --      to Wedermark;
those who perform noble deeds--      to such as these it shall be granted
that the battle-rush      he survive in one piece.'
Then they went faring      --the boat at rest awaited,
it rode on the sand      the broad-bosomed ship,
on anchor fast--      boar-figures shone
atop cheekguards      adorned with gold;
glittering and fire-hard;      life-guard they held;
war-spirits raised;      the men hastened,
marched forward together,      until they the timbered hall,
glorious and gold-trimmed,      were able to glimpse;
that was the foremost      --for earth-dwellers--
of halls under the heavens,      in it the ruler dwelt;
its light glimmered      over many lands.
Then to them the fierce fellow     --to that court of great men
glorious-- he lead,      that they to it could
go directly;      the worthy warrior
turned his horse,      thereupon spoke words:
'Time it is for me to go.      The Father all-ruling,
with grace      may He hold you
sound on your sojourns!      I will to the sea,
against brutal dacoits      keep watch.'
The street was paved with stones,      the path guided
the men together;      war-byrnie shone
harsh, linked by hand,      ring-iron glittering,
they sang in their arms,      as they to the hall straight
in their grim gear      came marching;
they set down, sea-weary,      their wide shields,
the rims wondrous-hard      against the wall of the hall,
and bent down then to a bench;      corslets rang--
the war-clothes of warriors;      spears stood,
seamen's weapons,      all together,
silvery above a grove of ash;      the iron-clad troop was
honoured in weapons;      then a proud noble
the elite soldiers      asked about the heroes:
'Whence ferry you      plated shields,
steel-hued shirts of mail      and masked-helms,
this host of army-shafts?      I am Hrothgar's
herald and officer;      I have not seen from a foreign land
this many men      looking braver in spirit;
I expect that you from valour,      not from exile,
but from greatness of heart      have sought out Hrothgar.'
Then him the renowned one      answered
--that proud prince of the Wedera nation--      spoke thereafter words,
severe beneath his helmet:      'We are Hygelac's
companions at table;      Beowulf  is my name;
I wish to proclaim to      the son of Half-Dane,
--that famed sovereign--      my errand
to your lord,      if he wishes to grant us
that we him, the virtuous one,      might greet.'
Wulfgar began to speak      --he was the Wendels' leader,
his courage was      well-known to many,
war-skill and wisdom--:      'I this from friend of the Danes,
lord of the Scyldings,      will inquire,
from the giver of rings,      --as you are petitioners--
from that famed sovereign      about your quest,
and to you the answer      promptly make known
which to me the virtuous one      sees fit to give.'
He turned then quickly      to where Hrothgar sat,
old and very grey,      amid his company of earls;
he strode grandly      so that he stood by the shoulders
of the Danes' lord:      he knew the custom of veteran-warriors;
Wulfgar made this speech      to his friend and lord:
'Here have ventured,      come from far away,
over the expanse of the sea,      men of the Geats;
the eldest one      of these elite warriors
is called Beowulf;      they are asking
that they, my lord,      with you might
exchange words;      give them not refusal
from your answers,      gracious Hrothgar;
they by their war-gear      seem worthy
of the esteem of nobles;      indeed, the prince is powerful,
who the warriors      led hither.'
Hrothgar spoke,      --the Helm of the Scyldings--:
'I knew him      when he was a youth;
his old father was      called Ecgtheow,
to whom gave into his home      Hrethel of the Geats
his only daughter;      now his heir is
come here bravely,      seeking a steadfast friend.
Further, it has been said by      sea-farers,
they who our gifts of coins      ferried for the Geats
thither in thanks,      that he thirty   
men's strength      in the grip of his hand,
renowned in war, has;      him holy God,
in benevolence,      has sent to us,
to the West-Danes,      of this I have hope,
against Grendel's terror;      I the good man must
for his great daring      offer precious treasures.
Be you in haste,      order to come in
to see me the noble band of kinsmen      all together;
Say to them also in words,      that they are welcome
to the Danish land.'     
A word from within announced:
'To you I am commanded to say      by my valorous lord,
the leader of the East Danes,      that he knows your noble history,
and you are to him,      over sea-swells,
--bold in thought--      welcome hither;
now you may enter      in your war-gear,
under visored-helmets,      to see Hrothgar;
let battle-boards      here await,
and wooden slaughter-shafts,      the result of words.'
Then the mighty one arose,      about him many warriors,
the glorious troop of thanes;      some waited there,
guarding the gear of war      as the hardy leader bade;
they hurried together;      the hero led the way for them
under Heorot's roof,
severe under his helmet,      until he stood in the hall.
Beowulf spoke      --on him a mail-coat gleamed,
a net of armour woven      by smith's skilful art--:
'Be you, Hrothgar, whole.       I am Hygelace's
kinsman and retainer;      I have many great labours
undertaken in my youth;      Grendel's enterprises have to me become,
on my native soil,      clearly known:
it is said by sea-farers      that in this hall stands,
--the best of buildings--      for each and every man,
idle and useless,      after evening-light
under the firmament of heaven      goes to hide.
Then I was advised that,      by my people,
the best ones,      the clever chaps,
sovereign Hrothgar,      that it were thee I should seek,
for that they the force of the strength      of mine knew;
themselves had looked on,      when I returned from battle,
stained with the blood of foes,      where I bound five,
destroyed ogrish kin,      and amid the waves slew
nicors by night;      I weathered distress in many a tight corner,
avenged injury done the Wederas      --they sought woe--
the foes I crushed,      and now against Grendel I am bound,
with that terrible creature,      alone,   to settle
the affair with the troll.      I now then you,
prince of the Bright-Danes,      want to request,
O protector of the Scyldings,      one boon:
that you not refuse me,      O shield of warriors,
liege and comrade of the folk,      now that I have come thus far;
that I might alone,      with my company of nobles
and this hardy horde of warriors,      cleanse Heorot;
I have also heard      that the evil creature
in his recklessness      heeds not weapons;
then I it scorn      --so that for me Hygelac may be
my liege-lord      blithe in his heart--
that I bear a sword      or broad shield,
yellow-rim to war,      but I with my grip shall
fight with this fiend      and over life strive,
enemy against enemy;      there must trust in
the judgement of the Lord,      whichever one that Death takes;
I expect that he will wish,      if he can compass it,
in the war-hall,      the Geatish people
to devour fearlessly,      as he often did,
the force of glorious warriors.      You will have no need for my
head to shroud,      but rather he will have me
fiercely stained with gore,      if me Death takes,
he will bear my bloody corpse;      he aims to bite,
the lone prowler eats      unmournfully,
marking the limits of his moor enclosures;      nor will you for the needs of my
body's funeral-provisions      have any further concern.
Send to Hygelac,      if I am taken by battle,
the best of battle-shrouds,      the one that protects my breast,
choicest of garments;      that is Hrethel's relic,
Wayland's work.        Fate goes always as She must.'
Hrothgar spoke,      the helm of the Scyldings:
'Fit to fight, you,      my friend Beowulf,
and for honour      us have sought.
Your father by striking began      the greatest feud:
he was Heatholaf's      slayer by his own hand
of the Wylfings;      then him his spear-kin
for dread of troops      could not shelter;
thence he sought      the South-Danes' folk
over the welling of the waves,      the Honour-Scyldings;
at that time I had just begun to rule      the Danish folk
and in my youth held      the precious kingdom,
the treasure-keep of heroes;      then was Heregar dead,
my elder brother      unliving,
the son of Half-Dane;      he was better than I.
Then the feud      I settled with fees;
I sent the Wylfings      across the water's ridge
ancient treasures;      he swore oaths to me.
It sorrows me to say      in my heart
to any man      Grendel has caused me what
humiliations in Heorot      with his thoughts of hatred,
carried out lightning-quick attacks;      my hall-troop is
waned, that war-band;      they have been swept aside by Fate
in Grendel's horrid violence;      God can easily
the rash ravager's      deeds put an end to.
Full oft have vowed,      having drunk beer,
over ale-flagons,      battle-men,
that they in the beer-hall      would await
Grendel's onslaught      with vicious edges.
Then, this mead-hall was      in the morning
this noble hall stained with gore      when the day lightened,
all of the benches      smeared with blood
the hall battle-gory;      I had friends the fewer,
cherished old battle-retinue,      for these Death took them away.
Sit now to feast      and untie your thoughts
of your glorious victories to the soldiers,      as your heart urges.'
Then the Geatish men were      gathered together
in the beer-hall,      room was made on a bench,
there the strong-souled      went to sit down,
proud in prowess      a thane performed his office,
he who in his hands bore      an ornate ale-cup,
decanted pure sweet mead;      a bard sang from time to time
clear in Heorot;      there was joy of heroes,
no small host      of Danes and Wederas.
Unferth spoke,      the son of Edgelaf,	
who sat at the feet      of the lord of the Scyldings;
he unbound battle-runes      --for him was the venture of Beowulf,
brave seafarer's,      a source of great displeasure,
because he did not grant      that any other man
ever glorious deeds the more      on middle-earth
heeded under the heavens      than he himself--:
'Are you the Beowulf,      who contested against Breca          
on the broad sea,      contended around the ocean-sound?
Where you for bravado      tempted the waters
and for a foolish boast      in deep sea
risked your lives,      you no man
--neither friend nor foe--      could dissuade
from that sorrowful jaunt,      when you rowed into the strait;
there you sea-currents      in your arms embraced,
traversed the ocean-roads,      with hands wove,
gliding over the sea;      the ocean in waves
welled, in winter's swells;      you in the water's grasp
toiled for seven nights;      he got the better of you on the sea,
he had more might.      Then he in the morning
on Heatho-Reams' shore      was cast up by the sea;
thence he sought      his own homeland,
dear to his people,      the land of the Brondings,
the fair citadel,      he had folk there,
boroughs and rings;      the entire boast with you
the son of Beanstan      truly fulfilled.
I expect then for you      worse results,
though you in war-assaults      everywhere prevailed,
grim combat,      if you for Grendel dare
the space of a night      nearby wait.'
Beowulf spoke,      the son of Edgetheow:
'Listen, you a great deal      --Unferth, my friend,
drunk on beer--      have spoken about Breca,
told of his journey.      Truth I claim
that I sea-strength      greater had,
hardship on the waves,      than any other man;
we had it agreed,      being lads,
and vowed      --being both then still
in the years of youth--      that we out on the ocean
our lives would risk,      and thus that we did.
We had naked swords      when we rowed on the ocean-sound,
hard in our hands:      we ourselves against whales
planned to defend;      not a whit from me was he
on the sea-waves far      able to float,
swifter on water,      nor did I wish to part from him;
then we together      were on the sea,
for the space of five nights,      until the sea-waves drove us apart,
the water welling,      the coldest of weathers,
the darkening night      and the north wind
fierce turned against us;      wild were the waves;
then was the sea-fishes'      wrath roused;
there me against foes      my body-shirt
strong and hand-linked,      did me help,
my battle-garment braided      lay on my breast,
adorned with gold;      to the bottom of the sea I was drawn
by the hostile foe-scather,      it held me fast,
cruel in grip;      however, to it was granted
that I the monster      reached with my point,
with battle-bill;      in the battle-rush I destroyed
the mighty sea-beast      with my hand.
Thus me often      hateful attackers
pressed sorely;      I served them
with my dear sword,      as it was fitting;
they the feast did not      have rejoicing,
those perpetrators of crime,      that they partook of me,
sitting round a banquet      near the sea-bed
but in the morning      by maiche-swords wounded,
along what is left by the waves      up they lay
put to sleep by swords,      so that never since
on the high waterway      sea-travellers
way did not hinder.      Light came from the east,
bright beacon of God,      the sea became still,
so that I the headlands      was able to see,
windswept walls.      Fate often spares
the hero not fated to die      when his courage endures.
However it was my good fortune      that I with my sword slew
nine of the nicors;      I have not heard by night
under heaven's vault      of a more grievous fight,
nor on the water-streams      of a more wretched man;
yet I the foes' grasp      survived with my life,
weary from my venture;      then the sea bore me off
flood following current      onto the land of the Lapps,
the tossing boat.      Not a whit of thee
in such strife of conflict      have I heard told,
of bill-blade terror;      Breca never yet
at battle-play,      nor either of you,
so boldly      performed a deed
with bright swords      --I do not boast of this--
nevertheless, you your brothers'      killer were,
near relatives;      for that you must with Hel
suffer torment,      though your mind is strong;
I say to you in truth,      son of Edgelaf,
that Grendel would have never so many      atrocities committed,
--that terrible demon--      to your leader,
humiliation on Heorot,      if your heart were,
and your spirit so battle-fierce      as you yourself tell
but he has found      that the fight he needs not,
that terrible storm of sword-edges      of your nation,
greatly to dread,      of the Victory-Scyldings;
he takes a forced toll,      spares none
of the Danish people,      but he carries on his delight,
slaying and despatching,      he does not expect contest
from the Spear-Danes.      But I shall him the Geats'
might and courage,      before long now,
offer in war;      a man will be able to go back,
to mead bravely,      when the morning-light
over the sons of men      of another day,
the sun clad in radiance,      shines from the south.'
Then was joyful      the dispenser of treasures,
with wizened hair and brave in battle      for support he trusted
the lord of the Bright-Danes      heard in Beowulf
the guardian of the folk,      firmly-resolved intent;
There was the laughter of heroes,      the noise made melody,
words were joyful.      Wealhtheow came forth,
Hrothgar's queen,      mindful of etiquette,
greeted, gold-adorned,      the men in the hall
and then the noble lady      gave out full cups,
first to the East-Danes      homeland-guardian,
bade him be blithe      at the partaking of beer,
beloved by the people;      he took in delight
feast-food and hall-cup,      the victorious king;
then she went among them,      the lady of the Helmings,
to veteran and youth      a portion to each,
gave rich cups,      until the time came
that she to Beowulf,      the ring-adorned queen,
blossoming in spirit,      carried a mead-cup;
she greeted the Geatish prince,      thanked God,
wise in her words,      for that her wish was to be fulfilled,
that she in any      noble man could count on
relief from wickedness.      He took that full-cup,
the slaughter-fierce warrior      from Wealhtheow,
and then spoke solemnly,      made eager for war;
Beowulf spoke,      the son of Edgetheow:
'I resolved that,      when I mounted the water,
sat down in the sea-boat      amid my company of warriors,
that I forthwith      your people's
will would work,      or fall in slaughter,
fast in the fiend's grasp;      I must perform
this daring act of courage      or the last day
in this mead-hall      of mine await.'
The woman these words      liked well,
the vow-speech of the Geat;      went gold-adorned,
the noble queen of the folk,      to sit by her lord.
Then were again, as before,      in the hall,
bold words spoken,      the people full of joy,
--victory-folk's clamour--      until presently
the son of Half-Dane      wished to seek
evening-rest;      he knew that the ogre
for the high hall      had plotted an attack,
ever since when they the sun's light      could see;
and darkening      night all over,
shadow-helm's shapes      came slithering,
black beneath the skies.      The troop all arose;
greeted then the man      the other man,
Hrothgar Beowulf,      and bid him health,
the wine-hall's ruler,      and spoke these words:
'I never to any man      before entrusted,
since I hand and shield      was able to raise,
this strong-hall of the Danes,      save to thee now;
have now and hold      this best of houses,
focus on glory,      show great valour,
keep watch against the enemy;      there shall be no dearth of your desires
if this courage-work you      survive with your life.'
Then Hrothgar went      with his band of heroes,
the protector of the Scyldings,      out of the hall;
he wished      to seek Wealhtheow,
the queen as companion in bed;      the glory of kings had,
against Grendel,      --so men heard--
the hall-guard posted:      special duty he held
for the chief of the Danes,      ogre-watch he kept.
Indeed the prince of the Geats      keenly trusted
in his prodigious power,      his Maker's favour,
then he from himself took      iron-byrnie,
helm from head,      gave his adorned sword,
the choicest of irons,      to his retainer,
and commanded him ward      his battle-gear;
the good man spoke then      some promise-words,
Beowulf of the Geats,      before he stepped into bed:
'I myself in martial-stature do not      tally poorer
in works of war      then Grendel himself;
therefore him with my sword I      shall not slay,
deprive of life,      though I fully am able;
he knows not the finer skills      that he may strike me back,
hew my rimmed-shield,      although he is renowned
for malicious works      but we at night must
relinquish short sword      if he dares to seek
war without weapons,      and then wise God,
on whichever hand,      the holy Lord
will allot glory,      as seems fitting to Him.'
The war-bold one then bent himself down      --the cheek-bolster received
the earl's face--      and round him many
brave seaman      sank down in hall-slumber;
none of them thought      that he thence would
his dear home again      ever visit,
his folk or his noble citadel,      where he was nurtured
for they had heard      that far too many of them already
in that wine-hall      slaughtering Death had carried off
of the Danish people.      But to them the Lord granted
the woven-destiny of war-luck      to the Wederas' men,
solace and support,      that they their foe,
through the strength of one,      all overcame,
by his own might;      truth is known
that mighty God      mankind
has ruled forever.      In the colourless night came
slinking the shadow-wanderer;      the shooters slept,
they that the horned-house      were obliged to guard,
all but one      --it was known to men
that they could not,      when the Maker did not wish it,
by the malefactor      be drawn under the shadows--
but he watching      in angry indignation
bided in rising rage      for the result of battle.
Then came from the moor      under the misty cliffs
Grendel walking,      God's wrath he bore;
the vile ravager meant      from mankind
a sample to snare      in the high hall;
he waded under the clouds      until he the wine-hall,
--the gold-hall of men--      mostly-certainly saw,
shining gold;      it was not the first time
that he Hrothgar's      home had sought;
he never in the days of his life,      ere nor after,
harder luck      or hall-thanes found.
He came then to the hall      the fighter journeying,
cut-off from merriment;      the door soon rushed open,
firm with fire-forged bands,      when he tapped it with his hands
plotting evil then he tore open,      now that he was enraged,
the mouth of the building;      straight after that
on the tessellated floor      the fiend treaded,
advanced angrily;      from his eyes issued,
most like a flame,      a distorted light;
he saw in the hall      many warriors
a sleeping company of kinsmen      gathered together
a great host of warriors.      Then his heart laughed:  
he intended to deprive,      ere the day came,
the cruel beast,      from each one
life from body,      now had befallen him
a hope of a full feast.      It was not his fate again
that he might more      of mankind
partake of after that night;      the mighty man beheld,
the kinsman of Hygelac,      how the cruel killer
by means of a sudden attack      wished to proceed.
That the monster did not      think to delay,
but he quickly grasped,      at the first occasion,
a sleeping warrior,      rended without restraint,
bit into the bone-locks,      from the veins drank blood,
swallowed great chunks;      soon he had
the unliving one      all devoured,
feet and hands;      nearer he stepped forth,
taking then with his hands      a stout-hearted
warrior from his rest,      reached towards him
the foe with his palm;      quickly he grasped
the malice thoughts      and clamped down on the arm.
At once he found,      the shepherd of atrocities,
that he had not met      in middle-earth,
in the expanse of the world,      in another man
a greater hand-grip;      he in his heart grew
fearing for life;      none the sooner could he away;
eager-to-go-hence was the thought in him,      he wanted to flee into the darkness,
to seek the devils' concourse;      his situation there was not
like he in the days of his life      ever had met.
The good man then recalled,      the kinsman of Hygelac,
his evening-speech;      upright he stood
and laid hold of him tight;      fingers burst;
the troll was striving to move outward,      the earl stepped forward.
The infamous one meant,      anywhere he so was able,
farther escape      and away thence
flee to his secret places in the fen;      he knew his fingers' control
in his enemy's grip,      that was a bitter journey he
that the harm-warrior      had taken to Heorot.
The noble hall broke into a din;      the Danes all were,
--the citadel-dwellers--      each of the bold,
earls in the flood of bitter drink;      enraged were both
fierce hall-wards;      the hall resounded.
Then it was a great wonder      that the wine-hall
withstood the war-fighters,      that it did not fall to the ground,
the fair mansion      but it so firm was
inside and out      with iron-bands
skilfully smithed;      there from the floor broke away
many mead-benches,      I heard,
adorned with gold,      where the enemies struggled;
it was not thought before,      by the sages of the Scyldings,
that it ever by means      any men
splendid and bone-adorned,      could break it up,
cleverly cleave asunder,      not unless fire's embrace
swallowed it in inferno.      Sound ascended up,
new, nearby:      the North-Danes stood
in ghastly horror,      in each one of
them who from the wall      weeping heard,
terrible screaming,      God's adversary,
a victoryless song,      bewailing his wound,
Hel's prisoner;      he held him fast,
he who was of men      in might strongest
on that day      in this life.
The protector of earls had no wish      for any reason
the murderous guest      to release alive,
nor his life-days      to any people
counted as advantage.      There many brandished
warriors of Beowulf,      old heirlooms,
they wished prince-lord's      life defend,
the legendary leader's,      if they could do so;
they did not know that,      when they joined the fray,
the bold-minded      battle-men,
and on each side      thought to heaw,
to seek the soul:      that the sin-scather
any on earth,      of the choicest of irons,
of war-bills, none,      could not at all greet him
but he victory-weapons      had forsworn,
every blade-edge.      His life-severing was bound to
on that day      in this life
be wretched,      and the alien-spirit
into the administration of fiends      would journey far away;
then he found,      he who before many,
miseries in his mind,      on mankind
atrocities committed      --he, who fought with God--
that him his body-shell      would not obey,
but him the daring      kinsman of Hygelac
had by the hand;      each was by the other
loathed while living;      body-pain he felt,
the awful ogre;      on his shoulder was
a great wound apparent,      sinows sprang asunder,
bone-locks burst;      to Beowulf was
war-glory given;      thence Grendel had to
flee sick unto death      under the hills of the fen,
to seek his joyless abode;      he knew it more surely
that was his life's      end arrived,
the day-count of his days.      For the Danes were all,
after that slaughter-storm,      wishes come to pass:
he had then cleansed,      he who had before come from afar,
shrewd and strong-minded,      the hall of Hrothgar,
rescued from ruin;      in his night's work he rejoiced,
in valour from great deeds;      to the East-Danes had
the Geatmen's leader,      his oath fulfilled;
so too anguish      all remedied,
grievous sorrow,      that they had ere endured,
and in hard distress      had to suffer,
no small misery;      that was a clear sign,
when the battle-bold one      the hand placed,
arm and shoulder      --there was all together
the grip of Grendel--      under the gaping roof.
Then was in the morning,      as I heard tell,
about the gift-hall      many warriors,
folk-chiefs arrived      from far and near
across wide regions      to behold the wonder,
the foe's foot-prints;      his parting from life did not
seem mournful      to any man
of those who the gloryless foe's      track observed,
how he weary      away thence,
vanquished by violence,      to the nicors' mere
doomed and driven back      left behind life-trails.
There with blood was      the water seething,
terrible swirling of swells      all mingled
with boiling gore,      with sword-blood it welled,
doomed to die he hid himself,      then, bereft of pleasure,
in his fen-refuge      he laid down his life,
his heathen soul;      there Hel embraced him.
Thence returned      old companions,
also many young,      from the sport-chase,
from the mere full-spirited,      riding horses,
warriors on fair steeds,      there was Beowulf's
glory proclaimed;      many often said
that neither south nor north      between the seas
over the whole vast earth,      no other
under the sky's expanse      was ne'er better
shield-bearer,      of a worthier kingdom;
nor, however, the friend and lord,      did they blame at all,
gracious Hrothgar,      for he was a good king.
At times the brave warriors      let leap,
in a contest raced      fallow horses,
where to them the earth-roads      seemed suitable,
and known to be the best.      At times the king's thane,
a man laden with fine speech,      remembering songs,
he who very many      of ancient traditions
recalled scores,      found new words
bound in truth;      the man then began
Beowulf's exploit      skilfully to recite,
and artfully utter      an adept tale,
varying his words;      he spoke of almost everything
that he of Sigmund      had heard said,
of his deeds of glory:      many uncanny things,
the striving of Wael's son,      his great journeys;
those things of which the childen of men      by no means knew,
feuds and feats of arms,      only Fitela with him,
then he of such matters      was wont to speak of,
uncle to his nephew,      as they always were
in every conflict      comrades in need;
they had a great many      of the giantkind
laid low with swords;      for Sigmund arose,
after the day of his death,      no little fame,
since the fierce warrior      had quelled the great serpent,
the keeper of a hoard;      beneath the hoary grey stone he,
the prince's son,      alone ventured
a dangerous deed,      Fitela was not with him;
however it was granted him      that the sword pierced
the wondrous wyrm,      so that it stood fixed in the wall,
the noble iron;      the dragon perished in the slaughter;
the fearsome one had      ensured by courage
that he the ring-hoard      might possess
at his own choosing;      he loaded the sea-boat,
bore in the bosom of his ship      the gleaming treasures,
Wael's son      --the wyrm in its heat melted--
he was of adventurers      the most widely famed
among nations,      the warriors' protector,
for deeds of valour      --he had prospered by this--
since Heremod's      skirmishing had abated,
affliction and spirit;      he among the Etins was
into enemy hands      given up,
quickly despatched;      the surgings of sorrow him
hindered too long;      he to his people became,
to all of the nobles,      a great mortal sorrow;
moreover they often mourned,      for in earlier times,
the departure of the stouted-hearted king,      many learnèd sages
who to him for miseries'      remedy had trusted and believed
that that prince's son      must prosper,
take up his father's rank,      rule the folk,
their treasury and citadel,      the heroes' kingdom,
homeland of the Scyldings;      he by all became,
the kinsman of Hygelac,      by mankind,
more esteemed;      wickedness undid him.
Now and then racing,      dusky streets
on their mounts they traversed.      Then was the morning light
hurried and hastened;      many retainers went
determined      to the high hall
to see the strange wonder;      the king himself too
from his wife's bower,      the ward of the ring-hoard,
stepped out splendid      with his great troop,
famed for his excellence,      and his queen with him,
passed down the meadhall-path,      accompanied by maidens.
Hrothgar spoke      --he went to the hall,
stood on the steps,      observed the steep roof
adorned with gold      and Grendel's hand--:
'For this sight      Thanks to the All-Ruler
be swiftly forthcoming!      I have suffered many injuries,
griefs from Grendel;      God can always work
wonder after wonder,      glory's Keeper.
It was not long past      that I for me any
for woes not hoped      for the bredth of my life,
to experience remedy      when adorned with blood
the most splendid house      stood battle-gory:
woe widespread      for each of the sages
those who did not hope      that in the span of their lives
the nation's fortress      from foes they could protect,
from shucks and shines;      now a warrior has,
through the Lord's power,      performed a deed
which we all      before could not
with schemes contrive;      listen, that may say
even so whichever woman      as that begot this man,
among mankind,      if she yet lives,
that to her the Old Measurer of Fate      was gracious
in child-bearing.      Now, I, Beowulf, you,
the best of men,      for me like a son would
love in life;      keep well henceforth
this new kinship;      there will not be any want
of worldly wishes      while I have power;
full oft I for less      rewards have bestowed,
honouring with treasure      a humbler man,
lesser at fighting;      you for yourself have
by deeds ensured,      that your fame lives
for ever and ever;      may the All-Ruler you
reward with good,      as He has now yet done!'
Beowulf spoke,      the son of Edgetheow:
'We the courage-works      with great pleasure,
endeavoured to fight,      boldly risked
the strength of an unknown foe.      I would rather
that you him himself      might have seen,
the fiend in his full gear      wearied by death;
I him quickly      in hard clasp
on the bed of slaughter      thought to fetter,
that he because of the hand-grip      of mine must
lie struggling for life,      lest his body slip away;
I him could not,      when the Measurer of Fate did not wish it,
hinder departing;      nor I so readily kept him close,
that mortal foe;      he was too overpowering,
the fiend in departing;      however, he left his hand
to save his life,      remaining behind,
arm and shoulder;      not with it though any
the worthless creature,      relief purchased;
not the longer does he live,      the hateful spoiler,
struck down by sins      but him the wound has
with violent grip      narrowly enclosed
in baleful bonds,      there he must await,
the creature stained with crimes,      the great judgement,
how him the glorious Measure of Fate      wishes to decree.'
Then the man was more silent,      the son of Edgelaf,
in boast-speech      of war-works
when the noble men,      by the strength of the prince
over the high roof      saw the hand,
the fiend's fingers;      on the front of each was,
in the place of each nail      very much like steel
heathenish hand-spurs,      the war-creature's
ungentle talon;      everyone said
that him no hard weapon      would strike,
pre-eminent iron,      that of them none the demon's
bloody battle-hand      would injure.
Then the order was promptly given      the interior of Heorot
to furnish by hands;      many there were,
of men and women,      who the wine-hall,
the guest-hall prepared;      gold-glittering shone
woven tapestries along the walls,      many wondrous sights
for each of the men,      who on such stared;
that bright building was      badly broken up
all inside      secure with iron-bands,
hinges sprung open;      the roof alone remained
entirely sound,      when the ogre,
guilty of wicked deeds      turned in flight,
despairing of life.      That is not easy
to flee from      --try he who will--
but he must gain by strife,      those who have souls,
compelled by necessity,      the mens' sons',
the ground-dwellers'      ready place,
there his body,      fast in his death-bed,
sleeps after feasting.      Then it was the time and occasion
that to the hall went      Half-Dane's son;
the king himself wished      to partake of the feast;
I have not heard when a tribe      in a greater force
around their treasure-giver      comported themselves better;
they then sank down on the bench,      the fame-bearers,
rejoicing at the feast;      they graciously received
many full goblets of mead,      their kinsmen,
stout-hearted,      in the high hall
Hrothgar and Hrothulf·      the interior of Heorot was
filled with friends;      no treacherous-strokes
the Folk-Scyldings      made as yet.
Then Beowulf was given      the brand of Half-Dane,
the golden banner      in reward of victory,
the adorned standard,      helm and byrnie;
the renowned treasure-sword      many saw
brought before the hero;      Beowulf took
the full flagon from the floor;      of the reward-gift he did not,
as payment,      need to be ashamed;
I have not heard that more graciously      four treasures,
adorned with gold,      many men
on ale-bench      have given to others;
around the helmet's roof      --the head-guard--
was wound with wires      the re-inforced crest guarded from without,
that him what the files have left      could not savagely,
could not harm the wondrously-tempered helm,      when the shield-fighter
against enemies      had to go.
The defender of earls then ordered      eight horses,
with decorated head-gear,      led onto the hall-floor
in under the ramparts;      one of them stood,
saddle skilfully adorned,      ennobled with jewels;
that was the battle-seat      of the high king,
when in sword-play      the son of Half-Dane
wished to engage;      in the vanguard it never failed
his warskill well-known,      when the slain were falling;
and then to Beowulf      both of the treasures
the protector of the Friends of Ing      bestowed possession,
horses and weapons;      he ordered him to make good use of them;
so in a manly manner      the famed chieftain,
the hoard-ward of heroes,      paid for war-clashes
in horses and treasures;      thus, one can never find fault in them
he who wishes to tell      the truth according to what is right.
Then, furthermore, to each one      of the earl's company
those with Beowulf      travelled the sea-path,
on the mead-bench      he gave treasures,
inherited relics,      and the one man decreed
to requite in gold      whom Grendel first
in wickedness quelled,      as he would have more of them
except for them wise God      that fate had prevented,
and this man's courage.      The Measure of Fate controlled all
for mankind,      as he now still does;
therefore understanding is      best everywhere,
the forethought of mind;      he must abide much
love and much hate      he who long here
in these days of strife      would enjoy the world.
There was song and sound      at the same time all together
before Half-Dane's      battle-plotter,
the glee-wood plucked,      a lay often recited
when a hall-performance      Hrothgar's bard	
before the mead-bench      was obliged to utter:
concerning Finn's heirs, with whom,      when disaster struck them,
the hero of Half-Danes,      Hnaef the Scylding,
on the Frisian battle-field      was fated to fall.
Truly, Hildeburh did not      have need to praise
the good faith of the Eotens;      she was guiltless,
bereft of her dear ones:      --in the war-play--
her son and brother;      they fell, in accorance with Fate,
wounded by spear;      that was a mournful woman.
Not without reason did      Hoc's daughter
grieve over Fate's decree,      when the morning came,
then she under the sky      could see
the baleful slaughter of kinsmen,      where before he had held the most
joy in the world,      war took all
of Finn's thanes,      except a few alone,
so that he could not      in that meeting-place
the clash with Hengest      conclude at all,
nor the woeful remnant      by battle dislodge from their position,
the prince's thane,      so they offered them settlement:
that they for them the other dwelling      would completely clear,
hall and high seat,      that they would half of it control
with the Eotens' sons      might have,
and at the giving of treasure      Folcwalden's son
each day      the Danes would honour,
Hengest's company      would revere with rings,
with even as much      precious possesions
of ornate gold      exactly as he the Frisian kind
in the beer-hall      would wish to embolden.
Then they pledged      on both sides
firm compact of peace;      Finn to Hengest
with incontestable earnestness      proclaimed an oath
that he the woeful remnant,      by sages' judgement,
would hold in honour,      that there any man
by word nor by deed      would not break the treaty,
nor in malicious artifice      ever complain,
though they their ring-giver's      killer followed,
leaderless,      and were thus forced by necessity;
if then any Frisian      by audacious speech
the murderous feud      were to remind them,
then it by sword's edge      must be thereafter.
The funeral fire was prepared,      and Ingui's gold,
raised from the hoard;      the War-Scyldings'
best battle-man      was ready on the bier;
at the funeral-pyre was      easily seen
the blood-stained mail-shirt,      the swine all-golden,
the boar hard as iron,      the prince had many
destroyed by wounds;      great men had fallen in slaughter;
then Hildeburh ordered      at Hnaef's pier
her own son      committed to the fire,
the body-vessel burned,      and put on the bier,
the wretched woman at his shoulder,      the lady lamented,
sorrowed with songs;      the warrior was laid out,
spiralled into the clouds      the greatest fire of the slain
roared before the mound;      heads melted,
the wound-gates burst open,      then blood sprang out,
from the hate-bites of the body;      the blaze swallowed all up,
--the greediest guest--      those who there were taken by battle
from both peoples;      their vigour was dispersed.
The warriors returned then      to seek their houses,
bereft of friends,      to see Frisia,
their homes and high fort;      yet Hengest
the death-stained winter      spent with Finn,
in a place with no fellowship at all;      he remembered his land,
though he could not      drive on the sea
the ring-prowed ship:      the sea welled in storm,
fought against the wind;      the winter locked the waves
in icy bonds,      until came another
year to the courtyards,      as it still does now,
those which continuously      carry out their seasons,
gloriously bright weathers.      Then winter was gone,
fair was the Earth's breast;      the exile was anxious to go,
the guest of the dwellings;      he of vengeance for grief
sooner thought      than of sea-path,
and whether he a bitter encounter      could bring about,
for that he of the Eotens' sons      inwardly remembered;
so he did not refuse      the worldly practice,
when to him Hunlafing      the battle-light,
the finest blade      he placed on Hnaef's lap;
among the Eotens its      edges were known.
So too his mortal enemy's      --Finn in turn received--
dire sword-onslaught      in his own home,
when concerning the fierce attack      Guthlaf and Oslaf,
following their sea-journey,      declared their grief,
blamed for their share of woes;      he could not his restless spirit
contain in his breast;      then the hall were decorated
with the foes' lives,      so too Finn was slain,
the king amid his troop,      and the queen was seized;
Scylding shooters      ferried to the ships
all of the house-goods      of the nation's king,
which they at Finn's estate      could find:
shining jewels and well-cut gems;      they on the sea-path
the noble lady      ferried to the Danes,
led to the people.      The lay was sung,
the gleeman's tale;      joy again sprang up,
music rang out from the bench,      cup-bearers served
wine from wondrous vessels.      Then Wealhtheow came forth,
walking in a golden neck-ring      to where the good pair
sat, uncle and nephew;      then their kinship was still together,
each to the other true;      Unferth the þyle was also there
sitting at the feet of the Scylding lord;     each of them trusted his spirit,
and that he had great courage,      though he to his kin was not
honourable in clash of blades;      the Scylding lady then spoke:
'Receive this full cup,      my noble lord,
dispenser of treasure;      you--be joyful,
gold-friend of men,      and to the Geats speak
with gentle words      so ought a man to do;
be gracious with the Geats,      mindful of gifts
which from near and far      you now have;
it has been said to me      that you wish for a son,
to have this leader of armies;      Heorot is cleansed,
the bright ring-hall;      enjoy, while you may,	
many rewards,      and leave to your kinsmen
folk and kingdom      when you must go forth
to meet what is fated;      I know my
gracious Hrothulf,      that he the youths wishes
to hold in honour,      if you earlier than he,
friend of the Scyldings,      leave behind the world,
I think that he with good      will repay
our children,      if he that at all remembers,
what we for his sake      and for his worldly renown,
before, in his youth,      bestowed our favours.'
She turned then by the bench,      where her boys were,
Hrethric and Hrothmund,      and heroes' sons,
the young company all together;      there sat the good
Beowulf of the Geats      by the two brothers.
The full cup was brought to him,      and a friendly invitation
proffered in words,      and twisted gold
kindly offered:      two arm-ornaments,
robe and rings,      the largest necklace
of those which I on earth      have heard of;
none under the sky I      have heard of better
from hoard-treasures of heroes,      since Hama carried off
to the battle-bright stronghold      the Brosings' necklet,
jewel and precious setting;      he fled the cunning enmity
of Eormenric,      chose eternal benefit;
That ring had      Hygelac of the Geats,	
grandson of Swerting,      on his last adventure,
when under the banner he      defended riches,
warded slaughter-spoils;      him Fate took away,
after he from pride      sought misery,
feud with the Frisians;      he then wore the ornament,
the mysterious stone      over the waves' cup,
the mighty prince;      he fell under the rimmed-shield.
Passed then into the Franks' grasp      the body of the king,
mail-coat      and the ring together;
lesser warrior      rifled the corpses
after the slaughter of battle;      the people of the Geats
filled the field of corpses.      The hall resounded with noise;
Wealhtheow spoke;      she spoke before the retinue:
'Make use of this ring,      belovèd Beowulf,
young man, with good fortune,      and take benefit from this corslet,
the wealth of a nation,      and prosper well,
prove yourself with strength,      and to these lads be
gentle in teaching;      I shall remember you for this requital;
you have brought it about      that you far and near
always and forever      men will praise,
even as widely      as the sea surrounds
the home of the wind, walls;      be while you live,
prince, happy;      I wish thee well,
and rich in treasure;      be you to my sons
indulgent in deeds,      possessing joy;
here is each of the men      true to the others
generous in mind,      in the protetion of their liege-lord;
the thanes are united,      the people alert,
the warrior-retinue cheered by drink      do as I bid.'
She went then to her seat;      there was the finest feast,
the men drank wine;      they did not know their fate,
horrific destiny,      as it had happened
to many heroes,      after evening came,
and Hrothgar went      to his quarters,
the ruler to rest,      the hall guarded
countless earls,      as they often had done before,
they cleared away the benches from the floor;      over it was spread
bedding and bolsters;      one of the beer-drinkers,
eager and doomed,      lay down in his hall-couch;
they set at their heads      battle-bossed shields,
bright linden-wood;      there on the bench was
over each nobleman      easily seen
a battle-steep helm,      ringed byrnie,
and glorious mighty shaft;      their custom was
that they were often      ready for a battle
both at home and out harrying,      and either of these,
for just such times      as for their liege-lord
the need arose;      they were a good platoon.
They sank then into sleep;      one paid sorely
for his evening rest,      as had quite often happened,
when the gold-hall      Grendel warded,
inflict wrong      until the end came,
death for crimes.      That became manifest,
widely known by men,      that an avenger still
lived after the misfortunes,      for a long time
after the war-trouble,      Grendel's mother,
lady troll-wife,      remembered misery,
she who the dreadful water      had to inhabit,
the cold currents,      after strife arose through him,
a sword-slayer to      an only brother,
father's kin;      he went then stained,
marked by the murder,      fled human pleasures,
lived in the wilds.      Then awoke many
fated spirits;      Grendel was one of these,
the hateful sword-outlaw,      who found at Heorot
a watching man      biding for battle;
there with him the troll      came at close grips;
yet he remembered      the great strength,
generous gift,      which God gave him,
and he on the One-Ruler's      favour relied,
comfort and support;      by this he overcame the fiend,
subdued the spirit of hell;      then wretched he went,
deprived of joy,      to see his place of death,
that foe of mankind.      And his mother even now,
greedy and gloomy-hearted      wished to go forth,
a sorrowful journey,      to avenge her son's death;
she came then to Heorot,      where the Ring-Danes
slept throught the hall;      then there at once came about
the earl's reversal of fortune,      when inside passed
Grendel's mother;      the horror was less
by even so much,      as is maid's strength,
--the war-violence of woman--      from an armed man,
when adorned blade,      by hammer forged,
--sword stained with blood--      the boar-crest
by edges firm,      the opposing helmet is sheared.
Then in the hall was drawn a hard-edged
sword above the seats,      many a broad bossed-shield
held fast in hand;      helmet was not heeded,
nor broad byrnie,      when the horror perceived him;
she was in haste,      wanted out of there,
to protect her life,      when she was discovered;
quickly she a noble      one had
seized tightly,      then she went to the fen;
he was to Hrothgar      the best-loved hero
in the retinue's rank      between the two seas
mighty shield-warrior,      whom she ripped from his rest,
the glorious man      --Beowulf was not there,
but was in the other lodging      assigned earlier
after the treasure-giving      to the mighty Geat--
a cry was in Heorot;      she took from its gore
a well-known arm;      sorrow was renewed,
it returned to their dwellings;      that exchange was not good,
which they on both sides      were obliged to pay for
with the lives of friends;      then was the wise king,
the grey battle-man,      in a troubled spirit,
when he the lordly thane      unliving,
the dearest one,      knew was dead.
Quickly to the bower was      Beowulf fetched
the victorious warrior;      at day-break
the notable earl went      --noble champion--
himself with his companions      where the wise one awaited
whether for him the Ruler of Elves      ever would wish,
after the news of woe,      to bring about a change for the better;
then over the floor went      the war-worthy man
with his crowd of companions      --the wood of the hall resounded--
he the wise king      humbled with words:
--the lord of the Ingwins--      asked if it had been for him,
according to his hopes,      a pleasing night.
Hrothgar spoke,      the Helm of the Scyldings:
'Do not you ask after pleasures;      sorrow is renewed
for the Danish nation;      Æschere is dead,
Yrmenlaf's      elder brother,
my confident      and my chief counsellor,
shoulder-companion,      when we in war
protected the head,      when clashed with foot-soldiers,
dashed boars atop helmets;      so ought a man
be experienced and noble,      as Æschere was.
In Heorot for him was      a hand-slayer,
restless death-spirit;      I know not whether,
glorying in the carcass,      she undertook a return journey,
contented by her feast;      she avenged the feud
in which you yester-night      Grendel quelled
through violent means      in harsh embrace,
because he for too long      my people
diminished and destroyed,      he fell in the fight,
having forfeited his life,      and now the other has come,
the mighty crime-wreaker,      she wants to avenge her kinsman,
and has very far      carried her feud,
as it must seem      to many a thane,
who for the treasure-giver      weeps in his heart:
hard mind-grief!      now the hand has fallen away,
which in all of you      had sustained wishes.
I it, land-dwellers,      my people,
hall-counsellors      have heard tell
that they saw      two such
massive marchers of no-man's land      haunting the moors,
alien spirits;      one of them was,
as they most certainly      were able to discern,
of the likeness of a woman;      the other one wretchedly shaped
in the form of a man      trod in the tracks of an exile,
except he was larger      than any other man;
in days of yore him      'Grendel' named
the earth-dwellers;      they did not know of his father,
whether of them any were      born previously
of obscure spirits.      They a secret land	
inhabited, wolf-slopes,      windy water-capes,
a dangerous passage over the fen-waters,      where mountain-stream
under the darkness of the headlands      descended downward,
the flood under the earth;      it is not that far hence
in mile-marks,      that the mere stands;
over it hangs      frost-covered groves,
tree held fast by its roots      overshadows the water;
there one may every night      a horrible marvel see:
fire on the water;      not even the wise of them lives,
of men's sons,      that knows the bottom.
Though the heath-stepper      harrassed by hounds,
the hart with strong horns,      seeks the forest,
put to flight from far,      first he will give up his life,
existence on the shore,      before he will leap in
to hide his head;      it is not a pleasant place;
thence a maelström of the waves      rises up,
dark to the clouds,      when the wind stirs
grievous storms,      until the air grows dark,
the skies weep.      Now is the remedy dependent upon
you alone once again;      you do not know the region yet,
terrible place      where you might find
the much-sinning creature;      seek if you dare;
for the feud you I      would reward with wealth,
with old treasures,      as I did before,
with twisted-gold,      if you come away.'
Beowulf spoke,      the son of Edgetheow:
'Do not sorrow, wise man·      it is better for everyone
that he his friend avenge,      than he mourn over-much;
each of us must      await the end
in the world of life:      gain he who may
glory before death;      that is for the warrior,
unliving,      afterwards the best.
Arise, O guardian of the kingdom,      let us go quickly,
Grendel's kin's      trail survey;
I swear it to thee:      she will not be lost in the cover,
nor in the embrace of the earth,      nor in the mountain wood,
nor in the ocean's depth,      go where she will;
this day you      must have patience
in each of the woes,      as I expect you to.'
The agèd one leapt up,      thanked God,
mighty Lord,      for what the man spoke;
then was for Hrothgar      a horse was bridled,
a mount with braided mane;      the wise ruler
rode well-equipped;      the foot-soldiers marched
linden-wood bearers;      tracks were
along the forest-track      widely seen,
the trail over the grounds,      went straight-forward
over the murky moor,      she carried of the kin-thanes
the finest      --without his soul--
of those who with Hrothgar      had defended their home.
Traversed then      the nobles' son
the steep stone slopes,      the narrow ways,
the tight single-file paths,      the unknown, uncertain water-crossings,
the precipitous headlands,      the many homes of nicors;
he with a few      went ahead
wise men      surveying the field,
until he by chance      mountain-trees
over a silvery-grey stone      found hanging,
the joyless forest;      water stood below,
bloody and stirred-up;      for all of the Danes was,
for the friends of the Scyldings,     suffering in the heart
to endure,      for many thanes,
awakening grief in each of the nobles,      when Æschere's
--on the sea-cliff--      head encountered.
The flood welled bloody      --the folk stared at it--
with flaming gore;      rapidly the horn sang,
urgent song of departure;      the troop all sat down;
they saw then through the water      many of the race of serpents,
strange sea-dragon      exploring the lake,
also on the cape-slopes      were lounging nicors,
they in mid-morning      often carry out
grievous sorties      on the sail-road,
serpents and wild beasts;      they rushed away
bitter and swollen with rage;      they perceived the clear note,
war-horn wailing;      one of the Geats' men
with a shaft and bow      separated it from life,
of wave-struggle      that in its heart stood,
a strong war-arrow;      it in the water was
swimming the slower,      when Death seized it;
fast it was in the waves      against boar-pikes
savagely-hooked      hard pressed,
viciously attacked,      and from the cape dragged out,
wondrous spawn of the waves;      men stared at
the gruesome guest.      Beowulf armed himself
in noble garments,      feared not at all for his life;
it was necessary that his army-byrnie,      braided by hands,
broad and cunningly adorned,      explore the lake,
it the bone-chamber      could protect,
that him the battle-grip      could not his heart,     
nor angry grasp of malice      his life scathe,
moreover the shining helm      warded his head,
that which the mere-depths      must stir up,
seek the mingling of waters      adorned with riches,
encircled with lordly-bands      as in far-days it
was wrought by weapons' smith,      wonderfully lengthened,
beset with swine-forms,      so that it then no
brond-blade nor battle-maiches      to bite were not able.
Not the least then of      his mighty supports,
that him in need lent      Hrothgar's þyle
--was the long-hilted maiche-sword's      name Hrunting--
it was one above      of ancient treasures;
edge was iron,      with poison-twigs patterned,
hardened with battle-blood;      never had it in a fight failed
any man,      who it in hands brandished,
he who terrifying journeys      dared to enter upon,
the domain of foes;      it was not the first time
that it courage-work      had been obliged to perform.
Indeed he could not have recalled,      the kin of Ecgelaf,
mighty in strength,      that which he had said before,
drunk on wine,      when he lent that the weapon
to a better swordsman,      he himself did not dare
under the waves' turmoil      to risk his life,
to carry out bravery;      there he forfeited glory,
fame from valour;      it was not so for the other,
when he himself for war      had equipped.
Beowulf spoke,      the son of Edgetheow:
'Think now, glorious      kinsman of Half-Dane,
wise chieftain,      now I am eager for the adventure,
gold-friend of man,      what we spoke of earlier:
if I in employment      of yours should
be parted from life,      that you for me ever would be,
having passed on,      in the place of a father;
be you hand-bearer to my      young retainers,
hand-companions,      if battle takes me,
so too you the treasures,      those which you gave me,
beloved Hrothgar,      send on to Hygelac;
he then will able to in the gold observe,      the lord of the Geats,
to perceive, the son of Hrethel,      when he on that treasures stares,
that I one of noble virtues,      a good king, had found,
dispenser of rings,      enjoyed while I could.
And let Unferth      the old heirloom,
the glorious wave-sword,      let the widely-known man
have that hard-edged sword;      I for myself with Hrunting
will gain glory,      unless Death takes me.'
After these words      the man of the Weder-Geats
hastened with courage;      not in the least for a reply
did he wish to await;      the surging-lake enfolded
the battle-warrior.      Then it was a long part of a day,
ere he the bottom      could perceive,
at once she found it out,      --she who the floods' expanse,
fiercely-ravenous, held      a hundred half-years,
wrathful and greedy--      that there one of the humans
the realm of strange being      explored from above;
then she groped towards,      seized the warrior
in terrible clasps;      Not the sooner she crushed inside
his hale body;      the ring-mail gave him protection from without,
that she the soldier-garment      could not penetrate,
the interlocked limb-coat,      with her loathsome fingers.
Then the sea-wolf bore,      when she had come to the bottom,
the lord of those rings      to her court,
so he could not      --no matter how brave he was--
wield his weapon,      but him so many bizarre things
smelled in the deep,      many sea-beasts
with battle-tusks      tore at his army-mail,
the horrors attacked.      Then the earl saw
that he in a hall of hatred      --I know not which-- was,
where not any water him      oppressed at all,
nor him, due to the the hall's roof,      was not able to reach
the sudden onrush of the flood;      he saw firelight,
a pale light      shining vividly;
then the good man saw      the accursèd one of the deep,
the mighty mere-wife;      he gave a powerful thrust
to the battle-bill,      did not withhold the swing of his hand,
so that on her head      the ring-marked sang out
a greedy war-song;      then the guest discovered
that the battle-brand      did not wish to bite,
to crush life,      rather the edge failed
the noble in his need;      it had endured already many
hand-to-hand encounters,      often split helm,
the war-garments of the doomed;      this was the first time
for the precious treasure      that its glory failed.
Again was resolute,      not at all slackening in courage,
mindful of fame      the kinsman of Hygelac
then he threw aside the twisting pattern sword,      adorned with ornaments,
the angry warrior,      so that it lay on the earth,
firm and steel-edged;      he trusted to strength,
his hand-grip of might;      so must a man do,
when he in war      intends to gain
long-lasting praise;      he cares not for his life.
Grabbed her then by the shoulder      --not in the least regretting the feud--
the prince of the War-Geats,      Grendel's mother;
the hard man of conflict then heaved,      now that he was enraged,
the deadly foe,      so that she fell to the floor;
she again him quickly      gave hand-reward
with wrathful grips      and clutched him against herself;
then, weary in spirit, he stumbled,      the strongest man,
warrior on foot,      so that he was in a fall;
then she bestrode the guest in her hall,      and drew her seax,
broad and bright-edged;      she wished to avenge her son,
only offspring;      on his shoulder lay
woven breast-net;      it protected life,
against point and against edge      it withstood entry.
Then he would have perished,      the son of Edgetheow,
under the yawning ground,      the champion of the Geats,
except that him the war-byrnie      provided help,
firm army-net--      and holy God
controlled the war-victory;      the wise Lord,
the Ruler of the heavens,      decided it rightly,
easily,      thereupon he stood up again.
He saw then among the arms     a victory-blessed bill,
an old giantish sword    with firm edges,
an honour of warriors,    it was the choicest weapon,
but it was more    than any other man
to battle-play    could carry,
good and stately,    the work of giants;
he seized then the ring-hilt,    champion of the Scyldings
wild and furiously battle-fierce,    he drew the ring-marked sword
without hope of life,    angrily struck,
so that through her neck    it clutched hard,
broke bone-rings;     the bill passed entirely through
the doomed cloak of flesh;    she fell on the floor;
the sword was bloody,    the warrior rejoiced in his work.
The gleam flashed,     the light stood within,
even as from heaven    shines brightly
the sky's candle;    he looked about the hall;
moved along the wall,    weapon raised
fierce with hilts,    Hygelac's thane,
angry and single-minded;    nor was that edge useless
to the battle-man,    but he quickly wished
to repay Grendel    for the many war-raids
which he had carried out    on the West-Danes
much more often    than on a single venture,
when he Hrothgar's    hearth-companions
slaughter in their slumber,    devoured in their sleep,
of the folk of the Danes    fifteen men,
and other such    had he carried out and off
hideous haul;    he paid him the reward of that,
the fierce fighter,    in that he saw in repose
war-weary    Grendel lying,
lifeless,     as he had injured him earlier
in the conflict at Heorot    --the corpse burst wide open,
when it after death    suffered a blow,
a hard sword-stroke--    and then its head he cut off.
Suddenly that saw     the wise fellows,
who with Hrothgar    looked at the lake,
that was turmoil of waves    all stirred up
the water coloured with blood;    with blended-hair,
aged, about the good man,    together they spoke,
that they that noble one    did not expect again
that he, triumphing in victory,    would come to seek
the glorious ruler;    then it many agreed,
that the sea-wolf him    had destroyed.
Then came then ninth hour of the day;    they abandoned the cape,
the brave Scyldings;    he went home hence,
the gold-friend of men;    the guests looked about
sick at heart,    and stared into the mere,
wished, and did not expect,    that they their lord and friend
himself would see.    Then that sword began
caused by the gore of battle    in icycles of battle,
the war-bill to wane;    that was a great wonder
that it all melted,    so like ice,
when frost's bond    the Father loosens,
unwinds water-ropes,    who has control
of times and seaons;    that is the true Creator.
He did not take into those dwelling,    the leader of the Weder-Geats,
more treasures,    though he there saw a great number,
but that head    and the hilt as well
shining with ornament;    the sword had already melted,
burned up the wavy-patterned blade;     that blood was so hot,
the venomous foreign spirit    who had perished there inside.
Straightaway he was in the water,    he who survived in strife,
the enemies' fall in war;    he dove up through the water,
the turmoil of waves was    all cleared,
the vast regions,    where the alien ghosts
gave up their life-days    and this borrowed world;
he came then to the land,    the seafarer's leader,
swimming stout-hearted;    he rejoiced in the sea-loot,
the great burden,    which he had with him.
They went towards him,    thanked God,
the mighty band of thanes,    they rejoiced for their lord,
that they him sound    were able to see;
then the vigorous man was from    helm and byrnie
quickly loosened    --the water grew still,
the lake under the clouds,    stained with the gore of death--
they fared forth thence     along foot-paths
happy in their hearts,    traversed the trail over the earth,
the familiar streets;    the men, bold as kings,
from that lake-cliff    bore the head
arduously,    for all of them,
full of spirit    --four had to
on the pole of the slain    to carry with difficulty
to the gold-hall    Grendel's head--
until presently    they came to the hall,
brave army-keen    fourteen
of the Geats moving,    with their lord of men,
proud in the throng,    trod on the plain near the mead-hall.
Then came in marching     the lord of the thanes,
the deed-bold man    exalted by glory,
the battle-brave hero,    to greet Hrothgar;
then it was by the hair    borne to the floor
the head of Grendel,    where men were drinking,
dreadful for the earls,    and the ladies with them,
a wondrous spectacle;    the men stared.
Beowulf spoke,    the son of Edgetheow:
'Listen, we you these sea-spoils,    son of Half-Dane,
lord of the Scyldings,    gladly brought
as token of glory,    which you look at here.
I it not easily    survived with my life,
war under water,    work risked
with trouble;    at once was
the warfare at an end,    unless God shielded me;
I could not in the battle    with Hrunting
bring about anything,    though that weapon is excellent
but to me granted    men's Ruler
that I saw on the wall    hanging fair
a mighty ancient sword    --most often He has guided
the one deprived of friend--    that I the weapon drew,
slew then in the strife,    when an opportunity was yielded to me,
the house's guardians;    then that battle-bill
burned up, wavy-patterned,     as the blood leapt out,
the hottest sweat of war;    I that hilt thence
carried back from the fiends,    foul-deeds avenged,
deadly slaughter of Danes,    as it was fitting.
I promise it to you then,    that you in Heorot may
sleep without sorrow    with your company of soldiers,
and each thane    of your nation,
veterans and youths,    that you for them need not dread,
chieftain of the Scyldings,    on that side,
life-bale for earls,    as you did before.'
Then was the golden hilt    to the old king
to the grey battle-leader,    given into his hand,
the ancient work of giants;    it had passed into the possession
after the devils' fall    of the lord of the Danes,
the work of wondersmiths,    and then this world gave up
the angry-hearted creature,    God's adversary
guilty of murder,    and his mother also;
it passed into the power    of the earthly kings
the finest ones    between the two seas,
of those who in Scandinavia     dealt out riches.
Hrothgor spoke;    he examined the hilt,	
the old heirloom,    on which was engraved the origin
of ancient strife,    when the flood slew
the pouring ocean,    the race of giants--
they fared terribly;    that was a tribe foreign
to the eternal Lord;    them the end-reward
through the surging of waters    the Ruler granted--
also was on the sword-hilt    of shining gold
in rune-staves    rightly marked,
it was set down and said,    for whom the sword wrought,
--choicest of irons--     had been first,
with a twisted-hilt and serpent-patterned;    then the wise man spoke,
the son of Half-Dane     all fell silent:
'That, indeed, may say    he who truth and right
performs among the folk,    remembers all from far-back,
old warden of the homeland;    that this hero was
born a greater man;    the fame is established
throughout the distant regions,    Beowulf my friend,
over each of the nations, of you;    all you it with patience hold,
strength with the wisdom of the heart;    to you I shall continue to give my
protection, as we spoke of before;    you must be as a comfort
all long-lasting    to your people,
to heroes a support.    Heremod was not so
to the sons of Edgewela,    to the Honour-Scyldings;
he grew not to their pleasure,    but for slaughter
and for annihilation    of the people of the Danes;
he felled in a furious spirit    his companions at table,
shoulder-comrades,    until he alone passed,
famous king,    from the joys of man
though him mighty God    with joys of strength
powerfully exalted    over all men,
further advanced    yet in his heart grew to him
the treasure of the breast eager for blood;     not at all did he give rings
to Danes for glory;    he lived joylessly,
so that he the strife's    pain suffered,
a great evil to the people for a long time.    You learn by this,
understand human virtue;    I this tale for you
recited, old and wise in winters.    Wonder is to say
how mighty God    to mankind
according to deep understanding     dispenses wisdom,
land and noble qualities;    he has control of all;
at times He in delight    lets go
the heart's thought of some man    of glorious kin
gives to him in his own homeland    earthly bliss
to command    a stronghold of men,
makes subject to him    from the world's portions,
a wide kingdom,    that he himself can not
in his ignorance    conceive the end of his rule;
he lives on in abundance;    they hinder him not a bit,
sickness nor age,    nor him evil sorrow
darkens in his soul,    nor strife anywhere
sharp-hate appears,    but to him all the world
turns on his pleasure;    he does not know it worse.
Until within him    pride's portion
grows and flourishes    then the warder sleeps,
the soul's keeper;    the sleep is too sound,
bound with troubles,    the killer is very near,
he who from his shaft-bow    foully fires;
then it is in the heart    struck beneath the helm
by the bitter dart    --he cannot protect himself--
from the perversity of strange biddings    of the wicked spirit;
it seems to him too little    what he rules too long;
cruel-mindedly covets,    he in arrogance never gives
golden rings,    and he then the future
forgets and disregards,    that which God gave him before,
glory's Ruler,    a share of honour·
it in the end    finally comes to pass
that the body,    lent, fails;
fated to death, it falls;    another body takes up,
who without regret    shares out treasure,
the earl's ancient wealth,    and he heeds not fear.
Guard yourself against this wicked strife,    beloved Beowulf,
finest man,    and for yourself choose the better,
the eternal gains;    do not pay heed to pride,
renowned champion;    now is the glory of your strength
for a while;    presently in turn will be
that you sickness or edge    will part from strength,
or grasp of fire,    or surge of flood,
or bite of blade,    or flight of spear,
or repulsive old-age;    or the brightness of the eyes
weakens and dims;    very soon will be
that you, warrior,    Death overpowers.
So I the Ring-Danes     a hundred seasons
have ruled under the skies    and in war sheltered them,
from many tribes     throughout this middle-earth,
from ash-shafts and sword-edges,    so that I for myself any,
under the expanse of the heavens,    adversary I did not account.
Listen, to me in the homeland for that    a reversal came,
sorrow after joy,    since Grendel became
an old contender,    invader of mine,
I from that persecution    endured continually
great sorrow of spirit;    thanks be for that to the Measurer of Fate,
eternal Lord,    from that I survived alive,
so that I on the head    sword-bloodied
after ancient strife     could gaze with my eyes!
Go now to the bench,    join in the pleasure-banquet,
honoured by your battle;    we must very many
treasures share between us    when it is morning.'
The Geat was glad-hearted,    went straightaway to
seek the bench,    as the wise one had commanded;
then it was again as before    for bold warriors,
for those sitting in the hall    they prepared a fine feast
once again;    the helm of night darkened,
dark over the company of warriors;    the veterans all arose;
the blended-haired one wishes    to seek his bed,
the aged Scylding;    the Geat exceedingly much,
valiant shield-warrior,    desired rest;
at once him the hall-thane    the weary journeyer
from afar    guided forth,
who for courtesy    looked after everything
of the hero's needs,    such as in those days
warrior-sailors    were obliged to have;
rested him then, the large-hearted man;    the hall towered
vaulted and gold-adorned;    the guest slept inside
until the black raven,    the joy of the sky
declared glad-heartedly.    Then came bright hurrying,
fighters hastening;
the nobles were    back to their people
eager to fare;    he wished far thence,
the high-spirited visitor,    to seek his ship.
He then directed the tough man    to wear Hrunting
the son of Edgelaf,    bid him take his sword,
beloved iron;    said thanks to him for the loan,
quoth: he the war-friend    marked well,
skilled in war;    he did not in words blame
the maiche's edge;    he was a proud man.
And then, eager to be going,    ready in arms,
were the warriors,     the one honoured by the Danes went,
noble to the high seat,    where the other was,
the battle-bold hero    greeted Hrothgar.
Beowulf spoke,    the son of Edgetheow:
'Now we sea-farers     wish to say
having come from afar,    that we are anxious
to seek Hygelac;    we here were well
entertained in our desires;    you have treated us well.
If then on earth I    can do anything
of your affections    earn more,
lord of men,    than I have done yet,
with feats of arms,    I am ready at once,
if I find it out    over the flood's expanse,
that you neighbouring-tribes    oppress with terror,
as enemies to you    sometimes did,
I to you a thousand    thanes will bring,
heroes as help.    I know of Hygelac,
the lord of the Geats,    though he is young,
the keeper of the folk,    that he would support me
with words and with deeds,    so that I might honour you rightly
and to you in aid     bring a forest of spears,
the support of strength,    where you be needful of men.
If him, on the other hand, Hrethric    to the Geatish court
decides to go, chieftain's son,    he shall there be able many
friends to find;    distant lands are
better sought    by one who is powerful himself.'
Hrothgar spoke     to him in reply:
'To you these sayings of words    the wise Lord
has sent into mind;    I have not heard more intelligently
at such young age    man make a speech;
you are strong in power    and wise in your heart,
judicious word-speaker;    I consider it likely
if it happens,    that from you the spear takes,
a horrendous battle    Hrethel's heir,
sickness or iron    your ruler,
the guardian of the folk,    and you have your life,
that the Sea-Geats    could not have better
by choosing    any other king,
hoard-ward of heroes,    if you wish to rule
your kinsman's kingdom.    Your spirit and heart me
pleases so well the longer I know them,    dear Beowulf;
you have achieved     that for the folk shall
the people of the Geats    and the Spear-Danes
in mutual peace,    and strife subside,
hostilities,     which they endured before;
shall be, while I rule    the wide kingdom,
wealth in common,    many an other
with good things will greet    over the gannet's bath;
the ring-prowed ship shall    bring over the high seas
offerings and tokens of friendship;    I know these nations
both towards foe and towards friend    firmly disposed,
blameless in everything,    in the ancient manner.'
Then again to him the protector of earls    gave to him,
the son of Half-Dane,    twelve treasures;
he commanded him with these gifts    his own dear nation
to seek in safety,    to return quickly;
kissed then,    the king the upright noble,
the chieftain of the Scyldings,    the best thane
and took him by the neck;    tears fell from him,
from the silver and gold whiskers;    in him were both thoughts	
old and deeply wise,    the second stronger,
that they afterwards    might meet,
brave in a formal summit;    the man was so dear to him
that he the welling of his breast    could not hold back
but him in his heart    in firm bounds of thought
for the dear man    a remote longing
burned in his blood.    Him Beowulf thence,
warrior proud with gold,    trod the grass-mound,
triumphing in treasure.    The sea-goer awaited
its lord and owner,    which rode at its anchor;
later on the journey was    the gift of Hrothgar
often praised;    that was one king,
in everything blameless,    until age deprived him
of strength's delights,    a thing which continually harms many.
They came than to the flood    full of spirit
of the young warriors;    ring-mail they wore
interlocked limb-shirts;    the land-guard perceived
the return of heroes,    as he did before;
he did not with insult    from the cliff's promontory
greet the guests,    but rode towards them,
said that welcome     to the people of the Wederas
the fighters with bright covering    he went to the ship;
then was on sand    the sea-curved boat
laden with war-garments    the ringed-prow
with horses and treasure;    the mast towered
over Hrothgar's    hoard-wealth;
he to the boat-guard     a bound gold
sword gave,    so that he afterwards was
on the mead-bench    by the treasure the worthier,
by the inherited relic.    Departed him on the ship
to trouble deep water;    he left the Danes' land;
then was by the mast    a mighty sea-garment,
sail fastened by rope;    the sea-beam thundered;
there the wave-floater was not     by wind over the waves
hindered in its venture;    the sea-goers went,
the foamy-necked floated    forth over the waves,
bound prow    over the ocean-streams,
until they the Geatish cliffs    could perceive,
the well-known headlands;    the keel rushed up
weather-beaten,    rested on the land.
Quickly was at the water    the ready harbour-guard,
he who already for a long time    for the beloved men
eager at the current    gazed far;
moored in the sand    the broad-bosomed ship
firm with anchor-bounds,    lest the force of the waves
the winsome timbers    might carry away;
he ordered then to carry up    the nobles' treasure,
trappings and gold ornaments;    it was not far thence for them
to seek    the giver of treasures
Hygelac son of Hrethel,    where he dwelt at home
himself with his companions    near the sea-wall.
The building was splendid,    the king of princely valour,
the high hall,    Hygd very young,
wise, well-thriving,    through few winters
in the walled town    had lived,
Haereth's daughter    was not mean though
nor too grudging of gifts    to the people of the Geats,
of treasure-wealth.    She showed violent arrogance,
the lusty queen of the folk,    terrible crimes;
dared not any of    the bold to risk,
of the dear companions,    except her great lord,
that on her by day    stared with his eyes
but for him slaughter-bonds    he might consider prescribed,
woven by hands;    quickly then was
after seizure    a maiche was appointed,
that it, shadow-marked,    was obliged to settle,
make known the evil of the death;    such queenly manner is not
for a lady to perform,    though she be matchless,
that peace-weaver    deprives life,
owing to a false injury,    of beloved man.
However, it was cut off at the heel     by Hemming's kinsman;
the ale-drinkers    further told
that evil for the people she    practised less,
malice and enmity,    since she first was
given, gold-adorned,    to the young champion,
of noble ancestry,    when she to Offa's hall
over the dusky flood    by her father's wisdom
sought in her journey    where she afterwards fully
on the throne,    for goodness famed,
the fated span of her life    her living she used well,
held high-love    for the heroes' lord,
of all mankind,    I have heard,
the finest    between the seas,
of the mighty race.    Because Offa was
in gifts and in war,    a spear-keen man;
widely honoured,    ruled in wisdom
his homeland;    then, exceedingly sad, he arose
a help to heroes,    the kinsman of Hemming,
grandson of Garmund,     powerful over strife.
Then the hardy man went    with his hand-picked retinue
himself along the sand    treading the sea-plain,
the wide strand;    the world-candle shone,
the sun eagerly from the south;    they had survived the journey,
strode quickly,    to where the Shield of Heroes,
--the bane of Ongentheow--      inside his citadel,
the young war-king,    they heard that there the good man
alloted rings.    To Hygelac was
Beowulf's journey    promptly reported,
that there in enclosed homestead,    the defender of warriors,
shield-companion    still living came,
from the war-play unharmed    going to to the court;
quickly was cleared,    as the king bade,
for the visitors on foot    the floor within;
then he sat down with the same man,    he who had survived the fight,
kinsman with kinsman,    after the liege-lord
through ceremonious speech    his loyal subject had greeted,
in emphatic words,    mead-draughts
passed round through that spacious room    Haereth's daughter,
--she loved the people--    bore goblets
to the hands of the illustrious ones.    Hygelac began
his hall-companion     in that high hall
to question courteously,    his curiosity burst forth,
whatever the Sea-Geats'    adventures were:
'How fared you on the way,    dear Beowulf,
when you suddenly    resolved far away
to seek conflict    over the salt water,
combat in Heorot?    Moreover, did you Hrothgar's
widely known woes    at all ameliorate,
for the famed chieftain?    I of this with anxious care of the heart
seethed with wellings of sorrow,    I did not trust the venture
of my dear man;    I begged you at length,
that you the slaughter-ghast    would not challenge at all,
let the South-Danes    settle themselves
the war with Grendel;    to God I speak thanks,
for that I you sound    am permitted to see.'
Beowulf spoke,    the son of Edgetheow:
'It is not secret,    lord Hygelac,
that great meeting,    to many men,
what a time of struggle    between the two of us, me and Grendel,
occurred in that place    where he great multitudes
for the Victory-Scyldings    brought about sorrows,
lifelong misery;    I avenged it all,
thus there is need to boast    --of Grendel's kinsmen,
evil upon the earth--    of that clash at dawn,
he who lives the longest    of that hateful race,
enveloped in malice.    I first came there
to that ring-hall    to greet Hrothgar;
straightaway to me the famed    kinsman of Half-Dane,
after he the purpose of the heart    of mine knew,
with his own sons    he appointed a seat;
The troop was joyful;    I have not seen in my whole life
under heaven's vault    a hall-sitters'
mead-revelry greater.    At times the renowned queen,
the peace-pledge of peoples,    passed over all of the floor,
urged on the young boys;    often twisted-rings she
gave to the warriors,    before she went to her seat;
from time to time before the band of experienced warriors     Hrothgar's daughter
to nobles continuously to the end    bore the ale-flagon,
those I Freawaru    the ones on the floor
I heard name her,    when she the studded cup
gave to heroes,    she is promised,	
young, gold-adorned,    to gracious son of Froda;
this has arranged    the Friend of the Scyldings,
the kingdom's shepherd,    and counsel reckons it
that he with this woman    a great part of the slaughter-feuds,
conflicts will settle.    Very seldom anywhere
after the fall of a leader    even a little while
the murderous spear bends down,    though the bride be good.
This then may displease     the chief of the Heatho-Bards'
and every thane    of that people,
when he with the maiden    walks on the floor:
that the noble sons of the Danes,    her veteran troop, are entertained,
on them glisten    ancient heirlooms,
hard and ring-adorned,    the Heatho-Bards' treasure,
so long as they those weapons    were able to wield.
Until they had led to disaster    in the shield-play
their dear companions    and their own lives.
Then speaks at the beer-drinking,    he who sees a ring-precious object,
the old ash-warrior,    he who remembers all
the spear-death of men    --in him is a fierce heart--
he begins sad-spirited    in a young champion,
by the musing of his heart,    to tempt his mind,
to awaken war-horror,    and speaks these words:
"Can you, my friend,     recognise that maiche,
which your father    bore into the fight,
under his army-mask    on the last campaign,
precious iron,    there the Danes slew him,
controlled the slaying-field,    when retribution failed,
after the heroes' fall,    the fierce Scyldings?
Now here of those slayers    the son of one or other of them,
exultant in trappings,    goes across the floor,
boasts of murder,    and wears the treasure
which you by right    ought to possess."
Thus he incites and reminds     every time
with grievous words,    until that time comes
that the woman's thane    for his father's deeds
from the bite of a bill-blade    sleeps, stained in blood,
having forfeited life;    him the other thence
escapes alive,    the land is readily known to him.
Then are broken    on both sides
the sworn oaths of earls;    then in Ingeld
murderous hate will well up     and in him the love of woman
surges of grief    will become cooler;
Therefore I the Heathobards'    loyalty do not consider,
the alliance's portion,    for the Danes untreacherous,
enduring friendship.    I ought speak further
again about Grendel,    that you may readily know,
giver of treasure,    what then happened,
the hand-fight of heroes    when heaven's gem
had glided over the earth,    the ireful guest came,
terrible, fierce in the evening    to visit us,
where we, unharmed,    warded the hall,
where was for Hondscio    a sinking battle
deadly evil for the doomed man;    he fell first,
the girded champion;    for him Grendel was,
the famed thane of distinction,    a slayer by mouth,
the belovèd man's     body swallowed up completely;
not the sooner out yet    empty-handed,
the slayer bloody-toothed,    wickedness in mind,
from the gold-hall    did he wish to go
but he, famed for his strength,    tested me,
gripped with an eager hand;    a pouch hung down
spacious and strange,    with cleverly-wrought clasps held fast,
it was cunningly    all devised
with devil's crafts    and dragon's skins;
he me there inside,    guiltless,
the daring instigator    wished to stuff,
as one of many;    he could not do so,
since I in anger    stood erect.
It is too long to recount    how I the scourge of the people
for each of his evils    paid in hand-requital
where I, my lord,    your people
honoured by acts;    he escaped away
for a little while,    enjoyed the joy of life;
yet from him the right,    a vestige, remained behind
hand in Heorot,    and he wretched thence,
gloomy in his heart,    sank into the depths of the mere.
To me for the bloody battle     the Friend of the Scyldings
with objects of plated gold    in plenty rewarded,
many treasures,    when morning came,
and we to the feast    had sat down
where was song and glee:    old Scylding
who has heard tell of many things,    from long ago narrated;
at times this battle-daring one    the harp for pleasure
the old-wood played;    sometimes recited a song,
true and tragic;     sometimes strange tales
he related rightly,    the open-hearted king;
at times he began again,    bound in his age,
the ancient war-soldier,    to mourn for his youth,
his battle-strength;    his heart welled inside,
when he, wise in winter,     recalled many things.
So we there inside     a whole long day
took pleasure,    until came night
another to men;    then was again swiftly
ready for grief-revenge     Grendel's mother,
she journeyed full of sorrow;    Death had taken her son,
the war-hate of the Wederas;    the horrible woman
avenged her child,    killed a warrior
savagely;     there was from Æschere,
the old, wise lore-counsellor,    life departed.
Nor could they him,    when morning came,
weary of death    the Danish people
cremate in fire,    nor lay on the funeral bale,
the beloved man;    she had carried off the corpse
in fiend's embrace    beneath the mountain stream;
that was for Hrothgar    the most bitter grief
which the ruler of the people    long had received.
Then me the chieftain,    by your life,
implored with troubled mind,    that I in the waters' tumult
perform a noble act,    risk life,
accomplish glory;    he promised me rewards.
Then I the welling waters',    as is widely known,
wrathful ghastly    guard of the deep found;
there a while we were    sharing a hand;
the water welled with gore,    and I cut off the head
in that deep-hall    of Grendel's mother
with mighty edges,    not easily thence
I carried off my life;    I was not doomed yet
but to me the protector of heroes    again gave
many treasures,    the kinsman of Half-Dane.'
So the king of the people    lived according to proper custom;
I by no means the gifts     had lost,
strength's reward,     but he gave me treasures,
the son of Half-Dane,    according to my own glory,
these I to thee, warrior-king,    wish to bring,
graciously to offer;    still is all in thee
dependent upon your favour;    I have few
near kinsmen    except you Hygelac.'
Then he commanded to be brought in    the boar-crested standard,
the battle-steep helm,    hoar-silver byrnie,
the beautiful war-sword;    the tale thereafter uttered:
'To me this battle-equipment    Hrothgar gave,
the clever ruler;    with some words he ordered,
that I first you its    legacy relate;
he said it owned    King Heorogar,
the leader of the Scyldings    a long time;
no sooner for that to his son    did he wish to give,
to bold Heoroweard,    though he was loyal to him,
the breast-armour.    Use it all well.'
I heard that with the treasure    four mares
swift, all alike,    followed behind,
apple-yellow;     he to him offered the gifts,
horses and riches.    So should a kinsman act:
not at all malice-nets    weave for others,
with hidden arts    contrive death
of hand-companions.    To Hygelac was
in fierce strife    his nephew very loyal,
and each the other's    benefit remembered;
I heard that he the neck-ring    gave to Hygd,
the exquisite marvel-jewel,    which Wealhtheow gave him,
chieftain's daughter,    three horses also
supple and bright with saddles;    then was her,
after receiving the ring,    breast adorned.
Thus he was bold,    the son of Edgetheow,
man famed in war,    for good deeds;
he led his life for glory,    never, having drunk, slew
his hearth-companions;    a troubled heart was not in him,
but he mankind's    greatest strength,
--that ample gift,    which God gave him--
he held, battle-daring.    Long had he been abject
so the sons of the Geats    did not reckon him good,
nor to him on the mead-bench    much honour
the commander of the troops    would grant;
they especially said,    that he was slack,
no bold noble;    a turn-around came
to the glory-blessed man    for each of these miseries.
Then the protector of heroes ordered    to be fetched in,
the war-noble king,    Hrethel's heirloom,
fitted out in gold;    there was not among the Geats then
a better precious treasure    in the manner of a sword;
that he in Beowulf's    lap layed,
and gave him    seven thousand hides of land,
residence and ruler's seat.    Theirs was both together
in that nation    inherited land,
earth by ancestral privelege,    to the second more
of that broad kingdom    to him who was higher.
After that it came to pass    in later days
in battle-clashes,    when Hygelac lay dead,
and for Heardred     battle-maiches,
under the cover of his shield,    became the instruments of his death,
when they sought him out    in the victory-tribe,
the fierce battle-ready warriors,    the Battle-Scilfings,
with enmity they attacked    the nephew of Hereric;
thereupon to Beowulf    the broad kingdom
passed into his hands;    he ruled well
for fifty winters    --then he was a wise king,
an old warden of the fatherland--    until one began
in the dark nights,    a dragon to rule,
he who in a high house    watched over a hoard,
a stark stone barrow;    the path below lay
unknown to men.    There went inside
a man, I know not which,    and he groped near
the heathen hoard,    his hands wrapped round
an ornamented bauble,    he got that afterwards;
though he who sleeping    had been tricked
by thief's cunning;    the people discovered that,
the neighbouring folk of men,    that he was enraged.
He was not at all in control     of the skill of the worm-hoard,
of his own desire,    he who sorely injured him,
because of dire-distress    a thief of I know not which
sons of men     fled hostile blows,
in need of a hall    and there within raged,
a man haunted by guilt,    immediately watched over;
then against the stranger    stood horror and terror;
nevertheless upon the wicked one    
poured peril.
He sought treasure-gold,    there was many such,
in that earth-hall,    ancient treasures,
as they in former days    some man,
this great legacy    of a noble kind,
full of thought,    had hid there
these dear treasures;    all of them Death took
in earlier times,    and then were yet one
of the old warriors of that people,    the one who moved about there longest,
the friend-grieving warden,    he hoped to delay that much,
so that he for a little while     the long-kept treasure
would be able to enjoy.    The barrow all-ready
occupied the plain    near the water-waves,
new on the headland,    made secure by difficult-craft;
there inside bore    of the treasure of earls
a hoard of rings    a hand-fashioned share
of plated gold;    some words he spoke:
'Now hold you, Earth,    now the heroes cannot
earls' possessions.    Listen, it formerly from you
was obtained by good men;    war-death has taken away,
terrible murder of life,    of crimes each one,
my belovèd people,    they gave this up to me:
they had seen joy in the hall;    he I have not, who might wield sword
or make beautiful    this gilded flagon,
this precious drinking vessel;    the veteran warriors are ill elsewhere;
must the stern helmet    adorned with gold
stripped of its ornaments;    the burnishers slumbers,
they who war-masks    ought to brighten;
also so the army's coats of mail,    which in battle endured
over the shattering of shield-boards    the bite of iron,
decay along with the men;    byrnie's ring may not
with war-fighter    fare widely,
alongside heroes;    there was not harp's joy,
delight of glee-wood,    nor good hawk
soaring through the hall,    nor swift horse
trampling the courtyard;    baleful death has
many of my living kin    sent forth.'
Thus sad at heart    in grief he bemoaned
one after all,    unhappily passed
days and nights,    until the flood of Death
reached to his heart.    Hoard-joy he found,
the old twilight-scather,    standing open,
he who, burning,    seeks barrows,
the naked malevolent dragon;    he flies by night,
encircled in fire;    him earth-dwellers
He has to seek
harm in the ground,    where he heathen gold
guards, wise in winters;    he is not a bit better for that.
So the people-scather    three hundred winters
ruled in the earth    of one of the hoard-halls,
vastly powerful,    until one angered him,
a man in pride:    he bore to his liege-lord
the gold-adorned cup,    begged peace-truce
from his lord;    then was the hoard ransacked,
rings' hoard borne off,    a boon was granted
to the wretched man;    a lord examined
the ancient work of men    for the first time.
then the worm awoke,    --quarrel was renewed--
he sniffed along the stone,    the harsh-hearted one found
the foot-print of his foe;     he too far forward had stepped
in his stealthy craft    near the dragon's head.
Provided that, one not doomed may    easily survive
woe and hardship,    he who the Ruler's
grace protects.    The hoard-ward sought
eagerly along the ground,    he wished to find the man,
the one who him in his slumber    had sorely harmed;
hot and fierce-minded,    he often circled among the mounds
all round the outside    --not any man there
in that wilderness,    but he rejoiced in battle,
of battle-work    --sometimes he turned back to the barrow,
sought the treasure-cup;    he suddenly discovered,
that a certain man had     disturbed the gold,
the high treasures;    the hoard-ward waited
with great difficulty,    until evening came;
then was enraged    the keeper of the barrow,
he wished the injury    to repay with flame,
the dear drinking-vessel.    Then the day was departed
to the joy of the wyrm;    he did not lie within the wall,
nor wished to wait,    but with bale-fire set forth,
infused with flame;    this beginning was terrible
for the people in the land,    as it soon was
upon their treasure-giver     painfully ended.
Then the demon began    to spew flames,
to burn bright houses;    the gleam of fire rose
to the horror of the men;    nor there anything alive
the hateful air-flier    wished to leave;
the war-strength of that wyrm was     widely seen,
the malice of the darkly cunning one    near and far,
how the war-scather    the people of the Geats
hated and humiliated;    back to his hoard he shot,
the hidden lord-hall    ere the time of day;
the inhabitants of the land had been     seized by flame,
in blaze and in fire;    his barrow he trusted,
his war-skill and his walls;    him this belief deceived.
Then was to Beowulf    the danger made known
quickly in truth,    that his own home,
the finest of dwellings,    in waves of heat melted,
the throne of the Geats;    that was to the good man
a grief in his heart,    of the mind-sorrows the greatest;
the wise man thought    that he the Ruler
against ancient law    eternal Lord
had bitterly angered;     inside his breast welled
with thoughts of gloom,    such was not usual for him.
The fire-drake had    the fortress of the people,
by the coast-land,    the stronghold
ground down with flames;    him for that the war-king,
the chief of the Wederas,    studied vengeance;
then he ordered to be made for him,    a warriors' protector,
all of iron,    the lord of earls,
a wonderous war-board;    he readily knew,
that him tree-wood    could not help,
linden-wood against fire.    He had to his seafaring-days,
the old, good noble,    abide the end
of life in the world,    and the wyrm together,
though the hoard-wealth    he had held long.
Then he scorned,    the rings' lord,
that he the wide-flier    would seek out with a troop,
a large army;    he did not the strife dread for himself,
nor him the wyrm's fire     esteem a bit,
power and courage,    for that he before many,
narrowly risking,    hostilities survived,
battle-clashes,    since he Hrothgar's,
--victory-favoured man--    hall cleansed,
and in war overwhelmed    Grendel's race,
hateful kind.    Not the least was	
the hand-to-hand encounter,    where one slew Hygelac,
after the Geats' king,    in war's rushes,
the lord and friend of the folk,    in Frisia,
Hrethel's heir,    died in the drink of sword,
beaten down by bill-blades.     Then Beowulf came
by his own strength,    he made use of the sea;
he had in his arms     thirty warriors'
battle-gear,    when he mounted the ocean;
not at all did the Hetwares    had need to be exulting
over the fighting on foot,    who forth against him
bore linden-wood shields;    few came back
from that warrior    to visit their homes.
He crossed over then the flowing expanse of waters,     the son of of Edgetheow,
wretched and solitary,    back to the people,
there Hygd bade him    hoard and kingdom,
rings and throne:    in her son she did not trust
that he against foreign peoples    the ancestral throne
had the power to hold    when Hygelac was dead;
not the sooner the destitute ones    could find
in the noble one     by any means,
that he to Heardred    would be a lord,
or the kingdom    wished to accept;
yet he to him among the folk    upheld with the counsels of a friend,
graciously in honour,    until he grew older,
ruled the Weder-Geats.    Him banished men
from across the sea sought,    sons of Ohthere;
they had rebelled against    the Helm of the Scylfings,
the finest    of sea-kings
who there in Sweden    dispensed treasure,
famed chieftain;    to him it became the end;
there he for his hospitality    received a mortal-wound,
from sword's swing,    the son of Hygelac;
and he went back,    Ongentheow's son
to seek his home,    after Heardred lay dead;
the throne he let    Beowulf hold,
to rule the Geats;    that was a good king.
He for the prince's fall    requital remembered
in later days,    to Eadgils he became
a friend in his plight;    with men he supported
over the wide sea    the son of Ohtere,
with warriors and weapons;    he had vengeance then
in cold grief-bringing ventures,    he deprived the king of his life:
so he each of the enmities    had survived,
dire conflicts,    the son of Ecgetheow,
deeds of courage,    until the one day,
when he with the serpent    must struggle.
Then he went,    one of twelve, swollen with anger,
the lord of the Geats,    to behold the dragon;
he had heard then    whence this feud arose,
wicked hostility for men:    to his bosom came
the precious vessel,    through the informer's hand;
he was in that     group    the thirteenth man,
he who this strife's    origin brought about,
the gloomy-minded captive;     he was obliged, humbly, thence
to lead the way to the place;    he went against his will
to where the earth-hall he    alone knew,
the cairn under the ground    near the surging of the sea,
the struggle of the waves;    it was full inside
of jewels and intricate metal-work;    an unpleasant guard,
ready, eager war-fighter    held golden treasures
old under the earth;    that was not an easy bargain,
to obtain    for any man.
Then on the headland sat    the violence-hard king,
while prosperity bid    to his hearth-companions,
the gold-friend of the Geats;    in him his heart was sad,
restless and slaughter-eager,    fate all too near
which the old man    must greet,
seeking the treasure of his soul,    sever asunder
life from limb;    it was not for long then
the nobleman's life    would be wound in his flesh.
Beowulf spoke,    the son of Edgetheow:
'In youth I many    war-storms survived,
in battle-times;    I remember all of that;
I was seven-winters old    when me the lord of treasure,
the lord and friend of the folk,    took from my father;
held and had me    King Hrethel,
gave me treasure and feast,    recalled kinship;
I was not by him in life    less in aught,
a man in citadel,    than each of his own sons,
Herebeald and Haethcyn    or my Hygelac.
For the eldest was,    unfittingly,	
by a kinsman's deeds    a death-bed strewed,
when him Haethcyn    from a horn-bow
his friend and lord    struck down with an arrow,
missed his mark    and his kinsman shot dead,
the one brother the other    with a bloody bolt;
that was an irreparable fight,    grieviously wronged,
heart-wearying in the breast;    yet must though
the noble unavenged    be parted from life.
In the same way it is tragic    for an old  man
to abide    that his son rides
young on the gallows:    then he utters a dirge,
a sorrowing song,    that his son hangs
for the pleasure of the raven,    and he can not him help,
old and experienced,    any provide;
ever is reminded    each morning,
of the other-world journey of his son;    another he heeds not
to wait for    within the strongholds,
guardian of inheritance,    when the one he has
through Death's compulsion    experienced deeds;
he sees, sad and sorrowful,    in his son's dwelling
a wine-hall wasted,    a wind-swept resting place
bereft of joy;    the riders sleep,
heroes hidden in graves;    there is not sound of harp,
revelry in the courts,    such as long ago there was.
He goes then to his bed,    sings a song of sorrow,
one man on account of one man;    it seemed to him all too roomy,
the fields and the dwelling-place.    Thus the Helm of the Wederas
on account of Herebeald    heart's sorrow,
welling, endured:    not a whit could he
on that life-slayer    settle a feud;
nor the more for that warrior    could he show hatred
with hostile acts,    though he by him was not loved;
he then with that sorrow,    which on him that sorely befell,
he gave over human joys,    choose God's light;
to his heirs he left,    as does a fortunate man,
the land and the folk-citadel,    when he departed from life.
Then was injury and strife    of the Swedes and the Geats
over the wide water    a quarrel shared,
hard military-spite,    after Hrethel died,
and to him Ongentheow's    heirs were
vigorous and martial;    they did not wish friendship
to hold across the ocean,    but around Hreosnabeorh
horrible, malicious raiding    often committed
that kin-friends    of mine avenged,
feud and crime,    as it was famous,
though one of the two with his    life paid,
a hard bargain;    for Hæthcyn was,
the Geats' lord,    war impending.
Then I heard in the morning    that one kinsman the other
with bill's edges    took vengeance on the slayer,
there Ongentheow    is attacked by Eofor;
the war-helm slipped asunder,    the agèd Scylfing
fell battle-pale.     The hand remembered
feuds a-plenty,    did not withhold life-blow.
I to him the treasures,    which he had given me,
repaid in war,    as was granted to me,
with flashing sword;    he gave me land,
earth, the joy of homeland;    there was not for him any need,
that he among the Gifthas    or the Spear-Danes
or in the Swedish Kingdom    needed to seek
a worse war-eager fighter,     to buy with wealth:
always, in the foot-troop, I him    wished to go before,
alone in the vanguard,    and thus must I always
act in battle,    while this sword endures
that which me, early and later,    has often served,
since I, in front of the legions,    of Daeghrefn was	
his slayer by hand,    the champion of the Hugas;
in no way the precious ornaments    to the Frisian king,
breast-adorning,     was he able to bring,
but rather with his contingent fell    the banner's keeper,
the noble in courage;    blade's edge was not the killer
but my battle-grip on him    his heart's beats,
his bone-house, broke.     Now I must with bill's edge,
hand and hard sword    fight for the hoard.'
Beowulf declared,     spoke vow-words
for the last time:    'I have risked many
wars in my youth;    yet I wish,
old, wise warden of the folk,    to seek vendetta,
to earn renown,    if me that wreaker of evil
from his earth-hall    ventures out to greet.' 
He then saluted    each of the men,
bold helm-bearers     for the final time,
dear companions:    'I would not bear a sword,
a weapon against the wyrm,    if I knew how
against the monster    else I might
grapple for glory,    as I did before with Grendel
but I there furious fire's    heat expect,
fierce and poisonous;    therefore I have on me
shield-board and byrnie;    nor will I from the barrow's guard
flee a foot    but for us it must
happen at the wall    as Fate allots us,
the Creator of all men;    I am bold in spirit
that I against the war-flier    forbear from boast.
You, await here on the barrow,    clad in byrnies,
warriors in war-gear,    which better can
during the slaughter-clash    survive wound
of the two of us;    it is not your adventure,
nor in the power of men,    save mine alone.'
He knew that against the beast    he would deal out his strength,
achieve noble rank;    'I must with courage
gain the gold,    or war takes,
terrible deadly wound,    your lord.'
Then he arose by means of his shield,    the bold warrior,
severe under his helm,    he wore sword-shirt
under stone cliffs,    trusted in the strength
of a single man;    such is not the coward's way.
He saw then by the wall,    he who a great number,
nobly good,    wars survived,
battle-clashes,    when armies collided;
it stood by the stone-arch,     a stream out from there
breaking out of the barrow;    there was the brook's surge
hot with deadly fire,    he could not near the hoard
without burning    for any space of time
endure the depths    on account of the dragon's fire.
Then he let from his breast,    when he was angered,
the Weder-Geat's leader,    a word burst out,
the staunch-hearted one roared;    his voice came in,
ringing battle-clear    beneath the hoary grey stone;
hate was aroused,    the hoard-guard knew
man's voice;    there was not more time
to ask for peace;    first came forth
the monster's breath    out of the stone,
hot battle-vapour;    the earth thundered;
the warrior below the barrow    swung his shield-boss
against the terror-guest,    the Geats' lord;
then was the ring-coiled one's    heart incited
to seek strife;    his sword before drew
the good war-king,    ancient heirloom,
imprudent with sword-edges;    was in each
of the harm-intending ones    terror of the other;
firm-spirited stood    with his steep bossed-shield
the brave leader of the friends,    while the serpent coiled
together swiftly;    He in war-gear waited;
went then burning     gliding coiled,
hastening to his destiny;    the shield defended well
life and body    for a lesser time
the famed chieftain,    then his mind desired,
where he that time    for the first day
had to wield it,    as Fate had not decreed for him
glory in battle:    he raised up his hand,
the Geatish lord;    the ghastly-hued one he struck
with his ancestral sword,    so that the edge weakened
bright on bone,    bit less fiercely
than its tribe-king    had need
driven in distress.    Then the barrow's ward was
after the war-blow    in a fierce spirit;
he spewed slaughter-fire;    widely spread
battle-light.    Of war-victory did not boast
the gold-friend of the Geats;    his war-bill failed,
naked in the violence,    as it should not have,
the excellent old iron;    that was not an easy accomplishment,
that the famed    son of Edgetheow
this earth    should be willing to give up;
he was obliged to be about to    inhabit a dwelling
elsewhere,    as must every man
abandon loaned-days.    It was not long to when
that the fierce enemies    again met each other:
the hoard-guardian heartened himself,     his breast swelled with breath,
another time;    cruelly suffered,
encircled in fire,    he who had once ruled a nation.
Not at all him in a troop     the hand-companions,
nobles' sons,    around him stood
with valour in battle,    but they sunk to the forest,
to protect life;    in one of them surged
his heart with sorrows;    kinship can never
aught be altered,    in him who thinks properly.
Wiglaf he was called,    son of Weohstan,
noble shield-fighter,    man of the Scylfings,
kinsman of Ælfhere;    he saw his liege-lord
under the war-mask    suffering heat;
he remembered then the honour    that he had given him before,
lush dwelling-place    of the Waegmundings,
to each folk-rights,    as his father had owned;
then he could not hold back,    his hand seized his round shield,
yellow lindenwood,    he drew his ancient sword;
it was among men    the legacy of Eanmund,
son of Ohthere;    of him in battle was,
of the friendless exile,    Weohstan his slayer
by maiche's edges,    and to his kinsman he brought back
bright-gleaming helm,    ringed byrnie,
an old ogrish sword;    that to him Onela returned,
his kinsman's    war-garment,
war-devised clothing;    he did not speak of the feud,
though he his brother's son    had slain;
he held the treasures    for many seasons,
bill and byrnie,    until his son could
accomplish noble deeds    like his old father;
then, among the Geats, he gave him     war-clothing,
of all kinds, in countless number,    then he went from life,
wise, on the way forth.    Then was the first time
for the young champion,    that he the rush of war
with his noble lord    had to perform;
his spirited heart in him did not melt away,    nor the remainder of his strength
fail in the fight;    then the wyrm had discovered,
when they together    had come.
Wiglaf spoke,    many proper words
he said to his companions    --his heart was sad in him--:
'I recall that time,     where we partook of mead,
when we promised    to our lord
in the beer-hall,    he who gave us rings,
that we to him for the war-gear    wished to repay,
if for him such    a need arose,
with helmets and hard swords.    Because of that he chose us from the army
for this adventure    of his own desire;
he deemed us worthy of renown,    and gave me these treasures,
because he us spear-warriors    considered excellent,
bold helm-bearers,    though the lord for us
this valiant work    intended alone
to perform,    the keeper of the folk,
because he of men the most    glories has achieved,
the most audacious deeds.    Now is the day come
that our liege-lord    has need of strength
of good war-men;    let us go to,
aid the battle-leader,    while the heat lasts,
the fierce fire-terror.    God knows of me
that to me it is much more agreeable,    that my body
with my gold-giver    the fire embraces;
it does not seem proper to me,    that we bear shields
back to our land,    unless we first can
fell the foe,    defend the life
of the chief of the Wederas;    I know well,
that his deeds of old are not such,    that he alone should
of the Geats' retinue    sorrow suffer,
to sink in strife;    for the two of us must sword and helm,
byrnie and rich shroud    both share.'
Then he waded through the smoke of slaughter,     bore his war-head
to the support of his lord;    a few words he spoke:
'Dear Beowulf,    carry out all well,
as you in youth-life    long ago said,
that you would not allow,    with you still living,
glory to fail;    you must now in bold deeds,
a noble firm in mind,    with all of your strength,
defend your life;     I shall support you.'
After those words    the wrathful wyrm came,
awful cruel visitor    a second time,
with hostile, gleaming flood of fire    to seek his foes
the hated humans;    the flame came forth in waves,
burned shield to the boss;    the byrnie could not
to the young spear-fighter    lend support
but the young man,    under his kinsman's shield
courageously advanced,    when his own was
consumed by fire.    Then again the war-king
remembered his strength,    with mighty force struck
with his battle-bill,    so that it stood in the serpent's head
driven by violence;    Naegling burst asunder,
failed in the fight    Beowulf's sword
ancient and silver-streaked;    it was not granted to him,
that for him irons'    edges could
help in battle:    the hand was too strong,
that each one of the blades     --I heard--
in stroke he over-taxed;    when he bore to battle
a weapon hardened by wounds,     it was not any better for him.
Then the scourge of people     a third time,
the fierce fire-drake     enmity in mind,
rushed at the brave man,    when he was yielded space,
hot and battle-fierce,    Beowulf's whole neck he clamped
between sharp fangs;    he was drenched
in life-blood;    gore gushed in waves.
I heard that then at the need    of the folk-king
the nobleman alongside    displayed courage,
strength and boldness,    as was natural to him;
he did not heed the dragon's head,    though the hand was burned
of the spirited man,    there he his strength helped,
that he the hostile outsider    struck somewhat lower,
the warrior in his war-gear,    so that the sword sank in
gleaming and golden    so that the fire began
to weaken after that.    Then again the king himself
gathered his wits,    drew a slaughter-seax
bitter and battle-sharp,    that he wore on his byrnie;
The Helm of the Wederas cut through    the wyrm in the middle.
The foe they felled    --their courage driving out life--
and then the both of them him    had destroyed,
the noble kinsmen;    so ought a man to be,
a thane in need.    That was for the chieftain
the last time of victory    by his own deeds,
in the world of action.    Then the wound began,
which him the earth-dragon    had caused earlier,
to swelter and to swell;    he soon discovered that,
it him in the breast    welled with deadly evil,
poison inside.    Then the noble went,
so that he by the wall    wise in thought
sat on a seat;    he looked on the giants' work
how the stone-arches     on firm pillars
the eternal earth-hall    supported within.
Then with his hands,    sword-bloody,
the renowned chieftain,    the immensely good thane
his friend and lord    washed with water,
weary of battle,    and unfastened his helm;
Beowulf spoke;    he spoke despite his injury,
the slaughter-wretched wound    --he readily knew
that he the length of his days    had fulfilled,
joy of earth;    then was all departed
his number of days,    death exceedingly near
'Now I to my son    I would have wished to give
war-garments,     if it had been granted to me such that
any guardian of inheritance    would be after
this body remaining;    I ruled the people
fifty winters;    there was not a folk-king
of my neighbours    --of any of them--
who me with war-friends     dared to greet,
to threaten with terror;    I on earth awaited
destiny,    ruled my own well,
did not seek cunning hostility,    nor swore me many
oaths unjustly;    I all of it can,
sick with mortal-injuries,    have rejoicing,
because he will not need to reproach me,    the Ruler of men,
for dire murder of kin,    when departs my
life from body.    Now go you quickly
to examine the hoard    under the hoary grey stone,
dear Wiglaf,    now the wyrm lies dead,
sleeping sorely wounded,    deprived of treasure
be now in haste,    that I the ancient wealth,
the possession of gold might perceive,    readily behold
sparkling cleverly-cut gems,    so that I can the more pleasantly
for treasure-wealth    leave my
life and nation,    that long I ruled.'
Then I heard swiftly    the son of Weohstan,
after the word-speech    the wounded lord,
listened to the battle-sick one,    bore a net of rings,
woven battle-shirt    under the barrow's roof.
He saw then victorious,    when he went by the seat,
the spirited young thane,    many precious jewels,
glittering gold    close to the ground,
wonders on the wall,    and the wyrm's den,
the old twilight-flier,    beakers standing,
the vessels of men of old    lacking a burnisher,
stripped of adornments;    there was a multitude of helms
old and rusty,    many arm-rings
cleverly fastened    --treasure easily may,
gold in the ground,    any one of mankind
overpower,     hide he who will--
also he saw hanging    a standard all-golden
high over the hoard,    the greatest of hand-wrought wonders,
linked with skill of hands;    from it light issued,
so that he on the ground    could perceive,
look over the ornament;    there was not of the wyrm
any appearance,    for him the blade-edge took.
Then I heard in the mound    the hoard plundered,
old work of giants,    one man,
him on his bosom loaded    goblets and plates
of his own judgement    he also took the banner,
the brightest beacon;  the bill     had already wounded
--the edge was iron--    of that old lord
him who the treasures'    protector was
for a long while;    the fire-terror had endured
hot for sake of the hoard,    fiercely welling up
in the middle of nights    until he died in violence.
The messenger was in haste,    eager for return,
urged on by treasures;    curiosity burst in him,
whether bold-hearted    he would meet alive
in that place,    the chief of the Wederas
ill in strength,    where he had left him earlier;
he then with that treasures    to the glorious chieftain,
his lord,    found bleeding,
of life at an end;    he again began on him
to sprinkle water,    until the word's point
broke through the breast-hoard,
the old one on the youth    saw gold:
'I, for these riches,    to the Lord of All, thanks
to the Glory-King    say by words,
to the eternal Lord,    which I look on here,
that I was able    for my people
before my death-day    to gain such riches,
now I for the hoard of treasures    have paid with my
old span of life.    Tend still
the need of the nation.    I cannot be here longer;
order war-famed men    to construct a mound
bright after the fire,    at the ocean's cape;
it shall to remind    my people
tower high    on headland of whales,
so that it sea-farers    then will name
Beowulf's Barrow,    those who ships
over the seas' mists    drive from afar.'
Took him from his neck    the golden ring,
the valiant chief,    to the thane gave,
to the young spear-warrior,    gold-adorned helm,
ring and byrnie,    told him to use them well:
'You are the last remainder    of our race,
of the Waegmundings;    Fate has swept off all
of my kinsmen    into destined death,
earls in their strength;    I must go after them.'
That was for the old man    the final word
of the thoughts of his breast,    ere he chose funeral fire,
hot furious seething;    yet from him went
his soul to seek     truth-fast judgement.
Then it went    with the young man
painfully,     that he saw on the ground
the dearest man    at the end of his life
miserably enduring;    the slayer also lay,
the terrible earth-dragon     bereft of life,
balefully beaten down;    the ring-hoard longer
the wickedly coiled wyrm    could not control,
rather him irons'     edges took off,
the hard, battle-notched    leavings of hammers,
so that the wide-flier,    stilled by wounds,
fell to the ground    near the hoard-store;
not at all through the air    flying turned
in the middle of nights,    proud of his prized possessions,
manifested an appearance,    but he fell to earth
by the battle-leader's    work of his own hands.
Indeed it on land    few men succeeded,
possessors of strength,    I have heard,
though he in all deeds    were daring;
that he against the poison-scourge's    breath rushed,
or its ring-hall    stirred up with hands,
if he a watching      warden found
living in the barrow;    for Beowulf was
the noble treasures' share,    repaid with death;
each of them had     arrived at the end
of his loaned life.    It was not long to when
that the battle-shirkers    gave up the forest,
cowardly troth-breakers,    ten together,
who had not dared before    with javelins to fight
in their liege-lord's    great need
but they, shamed,    bore shields,
war-clothing,     to where the old man lay;
they looked at Wiglaf;    he sat wearied,
the foot-soldier    near the shoulders of his lord;
he tried to rouse him with water,     but it availed him not a bit;
he could not on earth,     though he wished well,
in that first-spear    preserve life,
nor the Ruler's     man turn back:
the judgement of God would    rule the deeds
of all men,    as it still does now.
Then there was from that young man    a grim answer
easily got,    for him who earlier had lost his courage;
Wiglaf spoke,    Weohstan's son,
a man sore at heart    looked on the unloved men:
'That, indeed, may say     he who wishes to speak the truth,
that the liege-lord,    he who gave you treasures,
cavalry-gear,    that you stand in there--
when he on the ale-bench    often gave
to hall-sitters    helm and byrnie,
the chieftain to his thanes    such as he the grandest
anywhere far or near    was able to find--
that he completely    war-clothing
grievously threw away,    when fighting befell him;
not at all the folk-king    his companions in arms
need to boast about;    yet God granted him,
victories' Ruler,    that he avenged himself,
one with a blade,    when for him was need of valour.
I him life-protection     little could
provide in war,    and yet began
beyond my measure    to aid my kinsman;
ever was it the weaker    when I struck with sword,
the deadly enemy,    fire less fiercely
surged from the seat of intellect;    leaders too few
thronged around the chieftain,    when distress came to him.
How must treasure-receipt    and sword-giving
all native joy    for your kin,
delight cease!    Of land-rights must
of your clan    every man
become deprived,    when nobles
from afar learn    of your flight,
gloryless dead:    death is better
for all men    than a life of dishonour.' 
Then he commanded battle-result    to be announced at the stronghold,
up over the cliff-edge,    where that warrior-band
the morning-long day    sat sad in spirit,
shield-bearers,    in expectation of two things:
the end of his days    or the return
of the dear man.    On little was he silent
of the new tidings,    he who rode the headland,
but he truly    said over all:
'Now is the wish-giver    of the Wederas' nation,
the lord of the Geats    unmoving on his death-bed,
remaining in the repose of slaughter    by the wyrm's deeds;
beside him lies     his life-contender
sick with seax-wounds:    he could not with his sword
on that fearsome being    in any way
inflict wounds;    Wiglaf sits
over Beowulf,    the son of Weohstan,
one earl over another    unliving,
he holds, weary in his mind,    head-watch
over beloved and loathed.    Now for the nation one expects
time of warfare    when unsecret
to the Franks and Frisians,    the fall of the king,
widely becomes;    the quarrel was shaped
fierce against the Hugas,    when Hygelac came	
faring with a fleet    onto the Frisians' land
where him the Hetware    attacked in battle,
it happened in courage    with over-strength,
that the mailed-warrior    had to bow down;
he fell among the foot-troop;    not at all ornaments gave
the lord to his retinue;    for us was ever after
the Merovingian king's    kindness withheld.
I do not from the Swedes    peace or truce
expect a bit,    but it was widely known
that Ongentheow    of life deprived
Haethcyn Hrethel's son    at Raven's Wood,
when for arrogance     first sought out
the Geatish people    the War-Scilfings
at once him the wise, old    father of Ohthere,
ancient and terrible,    returned onslaught by hand;
he destroyed the sea-wise man,    he honoured his wife,
the old, wisened woman    bereft of her gold,
Onela's mother    and Ohthere's
and then he followed    those life-enemies,
until they escaped    with difficulty,
into Raven's Wood,    without a lord;
then he besieged the huge sacred grove,    the survivors of swords
weary with wounds;    he often threatened woes
to the wretched company    in the length of the night;
said: he in the morning    by the edges of a maiche  
he would sacrifice     one of them on the gallow-tree
as game for the birds;    relief came back
to the sorrow-spirited ones     together with early day,
when they Hygelac's    horn and trumpet,
and his battle-yell recognised,    then the good man came,
with the tribe's veteran warriors     travelling on the path.
The bloody swathe     of the Swedes and Geats,
the slaughter-rush of men    was widely seen;
how the folk between them     awoke a feud;
then the good man went    with his fellow kinsmen,
old and wise, greated saddened,    to seek a citadel;
the warrior Ongentheow    retreated higher up,
he had of Hygelac's    battle-skill heard,
the proud man's war-craft;    he did not trust his resistance,
that he the sea-men    could oppose,
against battle travellers    defend the hoard,
children and women;    he fell back thence
old behind the earth-wall;    then pursuit was offered
to the Swedish nation,    the standards of Hygelac
that place of refuge     forth overran,
when the Hrethelings    pressed forward into that entrenchment.
There was Ongentheow    by edges of swords,
the grizzle-haired    was compelled to pause,
so that the tribe-king    had to submit
to the sole judgement of Eofor;    him wrathfully
Wulf, Wonred's son,    reached with his weapon,
so that from him by the blow    blood in streams sprang
forth beneath his hair;    he was not frightened though,
the aged Scilfing,    but quickly repaid
with a more terrible response    for that slaughter-stroke,
when the tribe-king    turned thither;
he could not, the brave     son of Wonred,
to the old fellow    offer onslaught by hand,
rather he him on his head    had sheared his helm,
so that he, blood-stained,    had to bow down;
he fell on the field;    he was not doomed yet,
but he recovered himself,    though the wound touched him;
Let he, the hard    thane of Hygelac,
broad maiche,    when his brother lay dead,
the old ogrish sword,    the giantish helm
break over the shield-wall;    then the king bowed down,
the shepherd of the folk,    was struck to his life.
Then there were many,    who bandaged his kinsman,
they quickly raised him up,    when room was made for them,
so that they the place of slaughter    were able to control;
then plunder    the one man the other,
he took from Ongentheow    his iron byrnie,
his hard hilted sword,    and his helmet too;
the hoary one's armour    he bore to Hygelac;
he took the treasures    and fairly pledged to him
rewards among the people,    and did so;
he paid for the war-onslaught,    the lord of the Geats,
Hrethel's heir,    when he returned home,
to Eofor and Wulf    with an abundance of treasure;
he gave them both    a hundred thousand worth of
land and interlocked rings    --he needed not the gifts scorn,
any man on middle-earth,      since they gained those glories in fighting--
and then to Eofor he gave    his only daughter,
a honour to the home,    as pledge of friendship.
That is the feud     and the enmity,
the slaughterous hate of men,    for which I have woe,
they shall attack us,    the Swedish nation,
when they learn    our lord
is lifeless,     he who formerly preserved
against despisers    our hoard and kingdom,
after fall of heroes,    bold Scyldings,
supported the welfare of the folk,    or moreover
accomplished noble deeds.    For me haste is best,
that we the people-king    look upon there,
and that one bring,    he who gave us rings,
on a journey to the pyre;    nor must a part only
melt with that great-spirited one,    but there is the treasure's hoard,
gold uncounted,    bitterly purchased,
and now at last    with his own life
bought the rings:    then the blaze must devour,
the fire cover,    no man shall wear
these treasures in remembrance,    no pretty girl
shall have on her neck    ring-adornment,
but must, sad-hearted,    bereft of gold,
often, not once,    tread in alien land,
now the cohort-leader    has laid aside laughter
pleasure and merriment.    Therefore must be spears
many, morning-cold,    grasped in palms,
raised in hands,    not at all the sound of harp
to wake the warrior,    but the black raven,
eager over the doomed,    speaking many things,
telling the eagle,    how he succeeded in eating,
when he with the wolf    despoiled the slain.'
So the bold men    was teller
of hateful tidings;    he did not lie much
in deeds or in words.    The troop all arose;
they went unhappily     under the eagle's headland,
with welling tears,    to gaze upon the wonder;
they found then on the sand,     soulless,
ruling over his bed of rest,    the who gave them rings
in earlier times;    then it was the end-day
come for good men,    that the war-king,
the Wederas' chieftain,    died a wondrous death.
First they saw there    a rarer creature,
the wyrm on the ground    just opposite there,
the loathsome one lying dead:    the fire-drake was
a grim gruesome guest    burnt by flames;
it was fifty    foot-measures
long as it lay;    in air-joy it had ruled
the times of the night,    down again had gone
to seek its den;    it was then still in death,
it had of earth-caverns    enjoyed its end.
They stood by him     goblets and beakers,
lay plates    and precious swords,
eaten through by rust,    as if they had in the embrace of the earth
a thousand winters    remained there;
then was that legacy     of exceedingly powerful,	
gold of men of yore,    encompassed by an incantation,
that the ring-hall    could not touch
any man,    unless God himself,
victories' Truth-king    allowed he who He wished
--He is man's protector--    to open the hoard,
even so to every man    as it seemed fitting to Him.
Then it was seen     that the venture did not benefit
who he unrightly    had hidden inside,
vengeance under the walls;    this warden earlier slew
one man of a few;    then was the feud
wrathfully avenged.    It is a wonder where then
a man famed for courage     should meet end
of his fated life,    when he can no longer
one among his kinsmen,     inhabit a mead-hall;
thus it was for Beowulf,     when he the barrow's ward
sought treacherous quarrels:    he himself did not know
through what his parting from this world    must bring about.
Thus until judgement's day    deeply declared
the great princes,    who put it there,
that the man would be     guilty of crimes,
banned from sacred places,    in hell-bonds fast,
reproached for his transgressions,    he who plundered that place;
he was not liberal with gold    nor had he readily
the kindness of a lord     ever shown.
Wiglaf spoke,    the son of Weohstan,
'Often must many men,    for the will of one,
endure exile,    as it has happened to us;
we could not convince     the beloved prince,
the keeper of the kingdom,    by any counsel,
that he not greet    the gold-ward,
let him lie,    where he long had been,
inhabiting his abodes     until the world's end;
he held to his noble destiny;    the hoard is exposed,
grimly gained;    that was granted
too harshly which him     impelled thither.
I was there inside    and looked over all of it,
the trappings of the hall,    when the way was cleared for me,
not at all sweetly    was the errand allowed
inside the earthwall;    I seized in haste
much with my hands,    a mighty burden
of hoard-treasures,    bore it out hither
to my king;    he was still alive then,
wise and knowing;    he spoke much on many things,
old in his grief,    and commanded me greet you all,
bid that you build    in accord of your friend's deeds
in the cremation place    a high barrow,
large and splendid,    as he was of men
a warrior most honoured     thought this wide earth,
while he the prosperity of a city    could enjoy.
Let us now hasten    another time
to see and to seek    in that heap of cunningly wrought things,
a wonder under the walls;    I shall guide you,
so that you sufficient    close-up will see
rings and broad gold;     let the bier be ready,
quickly prepared,    when we come out,
and then carry    our lord,
beloved man,    where he must long
in the Ruler's     protection endure.'
He then commanded to direct,    the son of Weohstan,
the battle-brave hero,     many warriors,
house-holders,    that they the pyre-wood
to fetch from afar,     folk-chieftains,
to the good man:    'Now must the fire devour,
the dim flame grow,    the ruler of warriors,
he who often endured     shower of iron,
when the storm of arrows,    impelled by bow-strings,
shot over the shield-wall;    shaft held true to task,
its feather-trappings eager,    arrow-head followed.'
Indeed the wise    son of Weohstan
summoned from the troop     of king's thanes,
seven altogether,    the best;
he went, one of eight,     under the evil roof
one battle-man    bore in his hands
a fire-brand,    he who went in the fore-front.
It was not in a casting of lots,    who would plunder that hoard,
when unprotected    any part
the men saw    remaining in the hall,
lying frail;    little did anyone mourn
that they quickly     carried out
precious treasures;    the dragon too they shoved,
the wyrm over the cliff-wall,    they let the waves take,
the flood enfold,    that keeper of baubles;
that was braided gold     loaded on the waggon,
of each kind countless,     to the prince bore,
hoary grey from battle,     to the whale's headland.
Then for him prepared     the people of the Geats	
a pyre on the earth,     not trifling,
hung with helmets,    with battle-shields,
with bright byrnies,    as he had requested;
they laid then in the midst    the famed chieftain,
the lamenting heroes,     their belovèd lord;
then began on the barrow     the greatest bale-fire,
the warriors to kindle;    wood-smoke arose,
swarthy over the heat,     the roaring flame
woven with weeping    --the tumult of winds lay still--
until it the bone-house    had broken
hot at heart;     despairing in their hearts
they bemoaned their grief,    their liege-lord's death;
so too a death-dirge     a solitary Geatish woman	
wove for Beowulf,     cruelly bound,
she sang sorrowful,     earnestly of fortune
that she for herself days of harm    fiercely dreaded,
of multitude of slaughter-feasts,    terror of troops,
rapine and bondage.     Heaven swallowed the smoke;
then wrought    the Wederas' people
a barrow on the hill,    it was high and broad,
for wave-farers     widely visible,
and they constructed    in ten days
the war-chief's beacon,     the leavings of the fire,
with a wall they encircled,    as it most worthily
the very wisest men     could devise;
they placed in the barrow    rings and brooches,
all such trappings,    as before from the hoard
hostile men    had taken away;
the treasure of heroes they let    the earth hold,
gold in the gritty soil,     where it now still lives,
as useless to men    as it was before.
Then around the mound rode    the battle-brave
sons of nobles,    twelve in all,
they wished to bewail their sorrow,    to mourn their king,
to pronounce elegy,    and speak about the man;
they praised his heroic deeds    and his works of courage,
exalted his majesty.     As it is fitting,
that one his friend and lord    honours in words,
cherish in one's spirit,     when he must forth
from his body    be led;
thus bemourned    the people of the Geats	
their lord's fall,    his hearth-companions:
they said that he was,      of all kings of the world,
the most generous of men,    and the most gracious,
the most protective of his people,    and the most eager for honour.
