and he on the One-Ruler's favour relied,
comfort and support; by this he overcame the fiend,
subdued the spirit of hell; then wretched he went,
deprived of joy, to see his place of death,
that foe of mankind. And his mother even now,
greedy and gloomy-hearted wished to go forth,
a sorrowful journey, to avenge her son's death;
she came then to Heorot, where the Ring-Danes
slept throught the hall; then there at once came about
the earl's reversal of fortune, when inside passed
Grendel's mother; the horror was less
by even so much, as is maid's strength,
--the war-violence of woman-- from an armed man,
when adorned blade, by hammer forged,
--sword stained with blood-- the boar-crest
by edges firm, the opposing helmet is sheared.
Then in the hall was drawn a hard-edged
sword above the seats, many a broad bossed-shield
held fast in hand; helmet was not heeded,
nor broad byrnie, when the horror perceived him;
she was in haste, wanted out of there,
to protect her life, when she was discovered;
quickly she a noble one had
seized tightly, then she went to the fen;
he was to Hrothgar the best-loved hero
in the retinue's rank between the two seas
mighty shield-warrior, whom she ripped from his rest,
the glorious man --Beowulf was not there,
but was in the other lodging assigned earlier
after the treasure-giving to the mighty Geat--
a cry was in Heorot; she took from its gore
a well-known arm; sorrow was renewed,
it returned to their dwellings; that exchange was not good,
which they on both sides were obliged to pay for
with the lives of friends; then was the wise king,
the grey battle-man, in a troubled spirit,
when he the lordly thane unliving,
the dearest one, knew was dead.
Quickly to the bower was Beowulf fetched
the victorious warrior; at day-break
the notable earl went --noble champion--
himself with his companions where the wise one awaited
whether for him the Ruler of Elves ever would wish,
after the news of woe, to bring about a change for the better;
then over the floor went the war-worthy man
with his crowd of companions --the wood of the hall resounded--
he the wise king humbled with words:
--the lord of the Ingwins-- asked if it had been for him,
according to his hopes, a pleasing night.
Hrothgar spoke, the Helm of the Scyldings:
'Do not you ask after pleasures; sorrow is renewed
for the Danish nation; Æschere is dead,
Yrmenlaf's elder brother,
my confident and my chief counsellor,
shoulder-companion, when we in war
protected the head, when clashed with foot-soldiers,
dashed boars atop helmets; so ought a man
be experienced and noble, as Æschere was.
In Heorot for him was a hand-slayer,
restless death-spirit; I know not whether,
glorying in the carcass, she undertook a return journey,
contented by her feast; she avenged the feud
in which you yester-night Grendel quelled
through violent means in harsh embrace,
because he for too long my people
diminished and destroyed, he fell in the fight,
having forfeited his life, and now the other has come,
the mighty crime-wreaker, she wants to avenge her kinsman,
and has very far carried her feud,
as it must seem to many a thane,
who for the treasure-giver weeps in his heart:
hard mind-grief! now the hand has fallen away,
which in all of you had sustained wishes.
I it, land-dwellers, my people,
hall-counsellors have heard tell
that they saw two such
massive marchers of no-man's land haunting the moors,
alien spirits; one of them was,
as they most certainly were able to discern,
of the likeness of a woman; the other one wretchedly shaped
in the form of a man trod in the tracks of an exile,
except he was larger than any other man;
in days of yore him 'Grendel' named
the earth-dwellers; they did not know of his father,
whether of them any were born previously
of obscure spirits. They a secret land inhabited, wolf-slopes, windy water-capes,
a dangerous passage over the fen-waters, where mountain-stream
under the darkness of the headlands descended downward,
the flood under the earth; it is not that far hence
in mile-marks, that the mere stands;
over it hangs frost-covered groves,
tree held fast by its roots overshadows the water;
there one may every night a horrible marvel see:
fire on the water; not even the wise of them lives,
of men's sons, that knows the bottom.
Though the heath-stepper harrassed by hounds,
the hart with strong horns, seeks the forest,
put to flight from far, first he will give up his life,
existence on the shore, before he will leap in
to hide his head; it is not a pleasant place;
thence a maelström of the waves rises up,
dark to the clouds, when the wind stirs
grievous storms, until the air grows dark,
the skies weep. Now is the remedy dependent upon
you alone once again; you do not know the region yet,
terrible place where you might find
the much-sinning creature; seek if you dare;
for the feud you I would reward with wealth,
with old treasures, as I did before,
with twisted-gold, if you come away.'
Beowulf spoke, the son of Edgetheow:
'Do not sorrow, wise man· it is better for everyone
that he his friend avenge, than he mourn over-much;
each of us must await the end
in the world of life: gain he who may
glory before death; that is for the warrior,
unliving, afterwards the best.
Arise, O guardian of the kingdom, let us go quickly,
Grendel's kin's trail survey;
I swear it to thee: she will not be lost in the cover,
nor in the embrace of the earth, nor in the mountain wood,
nor in the ocean's depth, go where she will;
this day you must have patience
in each of the woes, as I expect you to.'
The agèd one leapt up, thanked God,
mighty Lord, for what the man spoke;
then was for Hrothgar a horse was bridled,
a mount with braided mane; the wise ruler
rode well-equipped; the foot-soldiers marched
linden-wood bearers; tracks were
along the forest-track widely seen,
the trail over the grounds, went straight-forward
over the murky moor, she carried of the kin-thanes
the finest --without his soul--
of those who with Hrothgar had defended their home.
Traversed then the nobles' son
the steep stone slopes, the narrow ways,
the tight single-file paths, the unknown, uncertain water-crossings,
the precipitous headlands, the many homes of nicors;
he with a few went ahead
wise men surveying the field,
until he by chance mountain-trees
over a silvery-grey stone found hanging,
the joyless forest; water stood below,
bloody and stirred-up; for all of the Danes was,
for the friends of the Scyldings, suffering in the heart
to endure, for many thanes,
awakening grief in each of the nobles, when Æschere's
--on the sea-cliff-- head encountered.
The flood welled bloody --the folk stared at it--
with flaming gore; rapidly the horn sang,
urgent song of departure; the troop all sat down;
they saw then through the water many of the race of serpents,
strange sea-dragon exploring the lake,
also on the cape-slopes were lounging nicors,
they in mid-morning often carry out
grievous sorties on the sail-road,
serpents and wild beasts; they rushed away
bitter and swollen with rage; they perceived the clear note,
war-horn wailing; one of the Geats' men
with a shaft and bow separated it from life,
of wave-struggle that in its heart stood,
a strong war-arrow; it in the water was
swimming the slower, when Death seized it;
fast it was in the waves against boar-pikes
savagely-hooked hard pressed,
viciously attacked, and from the cape dragged out,
wondrous spawn of the waves; men stared at
the gruesome guest. Beowulf armed himself
in noble garments, feared not at all for his life;
it was necessary that his army-byrnie, braided by hands,
broad and cunningly adorned, explore the lake,
it the bone-chamber could protect,
that him the battle-grip could not his heart, nor angry grasp of malice his life scathe,
moreover the shining helm warded his head,
that which the mere-depths must stir up,
seek the mingling of waters adorned with riches,
encircled with lordly-bands as in far-days it
was wrought by weapons' smith, wonderfully lengthened,
beset with swine-forms, so that it then no
brond-blade nor battle-maiches to bite were not able.
Not the least then of his mighty supports,
that him in need lent Hrothgar's þyle
--was the long-hilted maiche-sword's name Hrunting--
it was one above of ancient treasures;
edge was iron, with poison-twigs patterned,
hardened with battle-blood; never had it in a fight failed
any man, who it in hands brandished,
he who terrifying journeys dared to enter upon,
the domain of foes; it was not the first time
that it courage-work had been obliged to perform.
Indeed he could not have recalled, the kin of Ecgelaf,
mighty in strength, that which he had said before,
drunk on wine, when he lent that the weapon
to a better swordsman, he himself did not dare
under the waves' turmoil to risk his life,
to carry out bravery; there he forfeited glory,
fame from valour; it was not so for the other,
when he himself for war had equipped.
Beowulf spoke, the son of Edgetheow:
'Think now, glorious kinsman of Half-Dane,
wise chieftain, now I am eager for the adventure,
gold-friend of man, what we spoke of earlier:
if I in employment of yours should
be parted from life, that you for me ever would be,
having passed on, in the place of a father;
be you hand-bearer to my young retainers,
hand-companions, if battle takes me,
so too you the treasures, those which you gave me,
beloved Hrothgar, send on to Hygelac;
he then will able to in the gold observe, the lord of the Geats,
to perceive, the son of Hrethel, when he on that treasures stares,
that I one of noble virtues, a good king, had found,
dispenser of rings, enjoyed while I could.
And let Unferth the old heirloom,
the glorious wave-sword, let the widely-known man
have that hard-edged sword; I for myself with Hrunting
will gain glory, unless Death takes me.'
After these words the man of the Weder-Geats
hastened with courage; not in the least for a reply
did he wish to await; the surging-lake enfolded
the battle-warrior. Then it was a long part of a day,
ere he the bottom could perceive,
at once she found it out, --she who the floods' expanse,
fiercely-ravenous, held a hundred half-years,
wrathful and greedy-- that there one of the humans
the realm of strange being explored from above;
then she groped towards, seized the warrior
in terrible clasps; Not the sooner she crushed inside
his hale body; the ring-mail gave him protection from without,
that she the soldier-garment could not penetrate,
the interlocked limb-coat, with her loathsome fingers.
Then the sea-wolf bore, when she had come to the bottom,
the lord of those rings to her court,
so he could not --no matter how brave he was--
wield his weapon, but him so many bizarre things
smelled in the deep, many sea-beasts
with battle-tusks tore at his army-mail,
the horrors attacked. Then the earl saw
that he in a hall of hatred --I know not which-- was,
where not any water him oppressed at all,
nor him, due to the the hall's roof, was not able to reach
the sudden onrush of the flood; he saw firelight,
a pale light shining vividly;
then the good man saw the accursèd one of the deep,
the mighty mere-wife; he gave a powerful thrust
to the battle-bill, did not withhold the swing of his hand,
so that on her head the ring-marked sang out
a greedy war-song; then the guest discovered
that the battle-brand did not wish to bite,
to crush life, rather the edge failed
the noble in his need; it had endured already many
hand-to-hand encounters, often split helm,
the war-garments of the doomed; this was the first time
for the precious treasure that its glory failed.
Again was resolute, not at all slackening in courage,
mindful of fame the kinsman of Hygelac
then he threw aside the twisting pattern sword, adorned with ornaments,
the angry warrior, so that it lay on the earth,
firm and steel-edged; he trusted to strength,
his hand-grip of might; so must a man do,
when he in war intends to gain
long-lasting praise; he cares not for his life.
Grabbed her then by the shoulder --not in the least regretting the feud--
the prince of the War-Geats, Grendel's mother;
the hard man of conflict then heaved, now that he was enraged,
the deadly foe, so that she fell to the floor;
she again him quickly gave hand-reward
with wrathful grips and clutched him against herself;
then, weary in spirit, he stumbled, the strongest man,
warrior on foot, so that he was in a fall;
then she bestrode the guest in her hall, and drew her seax,
broad and bright-edged; she wished to avenge her son,
only offspring; on his shoulder lay
woven breast-net; it protected life,
against point and against edge it withstood entry.
Then he would have perished, the son of Edgetheow,
under the yawning ground, the champion of the Geats,
except that him the war-byrnie provided help,
firm army-net-- and holy God
controlled the war-victory; the wise Lord,
the Ruler of the heavens, decided it rightly,
easily, thereupon he stood up again.
He saw then among the arms a victory-blessed bill,
an old giantish sword with firm edges,
an honour of warriors, it was the choicest weapon,
but it was more than any other man
to battle-play could carry,
good and stately, the work of giants;
he seized then the ring-hilt, champion of the Scyldings
wild and furiously battle-fierce, he drew the ring-marked sword
without hope of life, angrily struck,
so that through her neck it clutched hard,
broke bone-rings; the bill passed entirely through
the doomed cloak of flesh; she fell on the floor;
the sword was bloody, the warrior rejoiced in his work.
The gleam flashed, the light stood within,
even as from heaven shines brightly
the sky's candle; he looked about the hall;
moved along the wall, weapon raised
fierce with hilts, Hygelac's thane,
angry and single-minded; nor was that edge useless
to the battle-man, but he quickly wished
to repay Grendel for the many war-raids
which he had carried out on the West-Danes
much more often than on a single venture,
when he Hrothgar's hearth-companions
slaughter in their slumber, devoured in their sleep,
of the folk of the Danes fifteen men,
and other such had he carried out and off
hideous haul; he paid him the reward of that,
the fierce fighter, in that he saw in repose
war-weary Grendel lying,
lifeless, as he had injured him earlier
in the conflict at Heorot --the corpse burst wide open,
