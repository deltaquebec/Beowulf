against brutal dacoits keep watch.'
The street was paved with stones, the path guided
the men together; war-byrnie shone
harsh, linked by hand, ring-iron glittering,
they sang in their arms, as they to the hall straight
in their grim gear came marching;
they set down, sea-weary, their wide shields,
the rims wondrous-hard against the wall of the hall,
and bent down then to a bench; corslets rang--
the war-clothes of warriors; spears stood,
seamen's weapons, all together,
silvery above a grove of ash; the iron-clad troop was
honoured in weapons; then a proud noble
the elite soldiers asked about the heroes:
'Whence ferry you plated shields,
steel-hued shirts of mail and masked-helms,
this host of army-shafts? I am Hrothgar's
herald and officer; I have not seen from a foreign land
this many men looking braver in spirit;
I expect that you from valour, not from exile,
but from greatness of heart have sought out Hrothgar.'
Then him the renowned one answered
--that proud prince of the Wedera nation-- spoke thereafter words,
severe beneath his helmet: 'We are Hygelac's
companions at table; Beowulf is my name;
I wish to proclaim to the son of Half-Dane,
--that famed sovereign-- my errand
to your lord, if he wishes to grant us
that we him, the virtuous one, might greet.'
Wulfgar began to speak --he was the Wendels' leader,
his courage was well-known to many,
war-skill and wisdom--: 'I this from friend of the Danes,
lord of the Scyldings, will inquire,
from the giver of rings, --as you are petitioners--
from that famed sovereign about your quest,
and to you the answer promptly make known
which to me the virtuous one sees fit to give.'
He turned then quickly to where Hrothgar sat,
old and very grey, amid his company of earls;
he strode grandly so that he stood by the shoulders
of the Danes' lord: he knew the custom of veteran-warriors;
Wulfgar made this speech to his friend and lord:
'Here have ventured, come from far away,
over the expanse of the sea, men of the Geats;
the eldest one of these elite warriors
is called Beowulf; they are asking
that they, my lord, with you might
exchange words; give them not refusal
from your answers, gracious Hrothgar;
they by their war-gear seem worthy
of the esteem of nobles; indeed, the prince is powerful,
who the warriors led hither.'
Hrothgar spoke, --the Helm of the Scyldings--:
'I knew him when he was a youth;
his old father was called Ecgtheow,
to whom gave into his home Hrethel of the Geats
his only daughter; now his heir is
come here bravely, seeking a steadfast friend.
Further, it has been said by sea-farers,
they who our gifts of coins ferried for the Geats
thither in thanks, that he thirty men's strength in the grip of his hand,
renowned in war, has; him holy God,
in benevolence, has sent to us,
to the West-Danes, of this I have hope,
against Grendel's terror; I the good man must
for his great daring offer precious treasures.
Be you in haste, order to come in
to see me the noble band of kinsmen all together;
Say to them also in words, that they are welcome
to the Danish land.' A word from within announced:
'To you I am commanded to say by my valorous lord,
the leader of the East Danes, that he knows your noble history,
and you are to him, over sea-swells,
--bold in thought-- welcome hither;
now you may enter in your war-gear,
under visored-helmets, to see Hrothgar;
let battle-boards here await,
and wooden slaughter-shafts, the result of words.'
Then the mighty one arose, about him many warriors,
the glorious troop of thanes; some waited there,
guarding the gear of war as the hardy leader bade;
they hurried together; the hero led the way for them
under Heorot's roof,
severe under his helmet, until he stood in the hall.
Beowulf spoke --on him a mail-coat gleamed,
a net of armour woven by smith's skilful art--:
'Be you, Hrothgar, whole. I am Hygelace's
kinsman and retainer; I have many great labours
undertaken in my youth; Grendel's enterprises have to me become,
on my native soil, clearly known:
it is said by sea-farers that in this hall stands,
--the best of buildings-- for each and every man,
idle and useless, after evening-light
under the firmament of heaven goes to hide.
Then I was advised that, by my people,
the best ones, the clever chaps,
sovereign Hrothgar, that it were thee I should seek,
for that they the force of the strength of mine knew;
themselves had looked on, when I returned from battle,
stained with the blood of foes, where I bound five,
destroyed ogrish kin, and amid the waves slew
nicors by night; I weathered distress in many a tight corner,
avenged injury done the Wederas --they sought woe--
the foes I crushed, and now against Grendel I am bound,
with that terrible creature, alone, to settle
the affair with the troll. I now then you,
prince of the Bright-Danes, want to request,
O protector of the Scyldings, one boon:
that you not refuse me, O shield of warriors,
liege and comrade of the folk, now that I have come thus far;
that I might alone, with my company of nobles
and this hardy horde of warriors, cleanse Heorot;
I have also heard that the evil creature
in his recklessness heeds not weapons;
then I it scorn --so that for me Hygelac may be
my liege-lord blithe in his heart--
that I bear a sword or broad shield,
yellow-rim to war, but I with my grip shall
fight with this fiend and over life strive,
enemy against enemy; there must trust in
the judgement of the Lord, whichever one that Death takes;
I expect that he will wish, if he can compass it,
in the war-hall, the Geatish people
to devour fearlessly, as he often did,
the force of glorious warriors. You will have no need for my
head to shroud, but rather he will have me
fiercely stained with gore, if me Death takes,
he will bear my bloody corpse; he aims to bite,
the lone prowler eats unmournfully,
marking the limits of his moor enclosures; nor will you for the needs of my
body's funeral-provisions have any further concern.
Send to Hygelac, if I am taken by battle,
the best of battle-shrouds, the one that protects my breast,
choicest of garments; that is Hrethel's relic,
Wayland's work. Fate goes always as She must.'
Hrothgar spoke, the helm of the Scyldings:
'Fit to fight, you, my friend Beowulf,
and for honour us have sought.
Your father by striking began the greatest feud:
he was Heatholaf's slayer by his own hand
of the Wylfings; then him his spear-kin
for dread of troops could not shelter;
thence he sought the South-Danes' folk
over the welling of the waves, the Honour-Scyldings;
at that time I had just begun to rule the Danish folk
and in my youth held the precious kingdom,
the treasure-keep of heroes; then was Heregar dead,
my elder brother unliving,
the son of Half-Dane; he was better than I.
Then the feud I settled with fees;
I sent the Wylfings across the water's ridge
ancient treasures; he swore oaths to me.
It sorrows me to say in my heart
to any man Grendel has caused me what
humiliations in Heorot with his thoughts of hatred,
carried out lightning-quick attacks; my hall-troop is
waned, that war-band; they have been swept aside by Fate
in Grendel's horrid violence; God can easily
the rash ravager's deeds put an end to.
Full oft have vowed, having drunk beer,
over ale-flagons, battle-men,
that they in the beer-hall would await
Grendel's onslaught with vicious edges.
Then, this mead-hall was in the morning
this noble hall stained with gore when the day lightened,
all of the benches smeared with blood
the hall battle-gory; I had friends the fewer,
cherished old battle-retinue, for these Death took them away.
Sit now to feast and untie your thoughts
of your glorious victories to the soldiers, as your heart urges.'
Then the Geatish men were gathered together
in the beer-hall, room was made on a bench,
there the strong-souled went to sit down,
proud in prowess a thane performed his office,
he who in his hands bore an ornate ale-cup,
decanted pure sweet mead; a bard sang from time to time
clear in Heorot; there was joy of heroes,
no small host of Danes and Wederas.
Unferth spoke, the son of Edgelaf, who sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings;
he unbound battle-runes --for him was the venture of Beowulf,
brave seafarer's, a source of great displeasure,
because he did not grant that any other man
ever glorious deeds the more on middle-earth
heeded under the heavens than he himself--:
'Are you the Beowulf, who contested against Breca on the broad sea, contended around the ocean-sound?
Where you for bravado tempted the waters
and for a foolish boast in deep sea
risked your lives, you no man
--neither friend nor foe-- could dissuade
from that sorrowful jaunt, when you rowed into the strait;
there you sea-currents in your arms embraced,
traversed the ocean-roads, with hands wove,
gliding over the sea; the ocean in waves
welled, in winter's swells; you in the water's grasp
toiled for seven nights; he got the better of you on the sea,
he had more might. Then he in the morning
on Heatho-Reams' shore was cast up by the sea;
thence he sought his own homeland,
dear to his people, the land of the Brondings,
the fair citadel, he had folk there,
boroughs and rings; the entire boast with you
the son of Beanstan truly fulfilled.
I expect then for you worse results,
though you in war-assaults everywhere prevailed,
grim combat, if you for Grendel dare
the space of a night nearby wait.'
Beowulf spoke, the son of Edgetheow:
'Listen, you a great deal --Unferth, my friend,
drunk on beer-- have spoken about Breca,
told of his journey. Truth I claim
that I sea-strength greater had,
hardship on the waves, than any other man;
we had it agreed, being lads,
and vowed --being both then still
in the years of youth-- that we out on the ocean
our lives would risk, and thus that we did.
We had naked swords when we rowed on the ocean-sound,
hard in our hands: we ourselves against whales
planned to defend; not a whit from me was he
on the sea-waves far able to float,
swifter on water, nor did I wish to part from him;
then we together were on the sea,
for the space of five nights, until the sea-waves drove us apart,
the water welling, the coldest of weathers,
the darkening night and the north wind
fierce turned against us; wild were the waves;
then was the sea-fishes' wrath roused;
there me against foes my body-shirt
strong and hand-linked, did me help,
my battle-garment braided lay on my breast,
adorned with gold; to the bottom of the sea I was drawn
by the hostile foe-scather, it held me fast,
cruel in grip; however, to it was granted
that I the monster reached with my point,
with battle-bill; in the battle-rush I destroyed
the mighty sea-beast with my hand.
Thus me often hateful attackers
pressed sorely; I served them
with my dear sword, as it was fitting;
they the feast did not have rejoicing,
those perpetrators of crime, that they partook of me,
sitting round a banquet near the sea-bed
but in the morning by maiche-swords wounded,
along what is left by the waves up they lay
put to sleep by swords, so that never since
on the high waterway sea-travellers
way did not hinder. Light came from the east,
bright beacon of God, the sea became still,
so that I the headlands was able to see,
windswept walls. Fate often spares
the hero not fated to die when his courage endures.
However it was my good fortune that I with my sword slew
nine of the nicors; I have not heard by night
under heaven's vault of a more grievous fight,
nor on the water-streams of a more wretched man;
yet I the foes' grasp survived with my life,
weary from my venture; then the sea bore me off
flood following current onto the land of the Lapps,
the tossing boat. Not a whit of thee
in such strife of conflict have I heard told,
of bill-blade terror; Breca never yet
at battle-play, nor either of you,
so boldly performed a deed
with bright swords --I do not boast of this--
nevertheless, you your brothers' killer were,
near relatives; for that you must with Hel
suffer torment, though your mind is strong;
I say to you in truth, son of Edgelaf,
that Grendel would have never so many atrocities committed,
--that terrible demon-- to your leader,
humiliation on Heorot, if your heart were,
and your spirit so battle-fierce as you yourself tell
but he has found that the fight he needs not,
that terrible storm of sword-edges of your nation,
greatly to dread, of the Victory-Scyldings;
he takes a forced toll, spares none
of the Danish people, but he carries on his delight,
slaying and despatching, he does not expect contest
from the Spear-Danes. But I shall him the Geats'
might and courage, before long now,
offer in war; a man will be able to go back,
to mead bravely, when the morning-light
over the sons of men of another day,
the sun clad in radiance, shines from the south.'
Then was joyful the dispenser of treasures,
with wizened hair and brave in battle for support he trusted
the lord of the Bright-Danes heard in Beowulf
the guardian of the folk, firmly-resolved intent;
There was the laughter of heroes, the noise made melody,
words were joyful. Wealhtheow came forth,
Hrothgar's queen, mindful of etiquette,
greeted, gold-adorned, the men in the hall
and then the noble lady gave out full cups,
first to the East-Danes homeland-guardian,
bade him be blithe at the partaking of beer,
beloved by the people; he took in delight
feast-food and hall-cup, the victorious king;
then she went among them, the lady of the Helmings,
to veteran and youth a portion to each,
gave rich cups, until the time came
that she to Beowulf, the ring-adorned queen,
blossoming in spirit, carried a mead-cup;
she greeted the Geatish prince, thanked God,
wise in her words, for that her wish was to be fulfilled,
that she in any noble man could count on
relief from wickedness. He took that full-cup,
the slaughter-fierce warrior from Wealhtheow,
and then spoke solemnly, made eager for war;
Beowulf spoke, the son of Edgetheow:
'I resolved that, when I mounted the water,
sat down in the sea-boat amid my company of warriors,
that I forthwith your people's
will would work, or fall in slaughter,
fast in the fiend's grasp; I must perform
this daring act of courage or the last day
