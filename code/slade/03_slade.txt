in this mead-hall of mine await.'
The woman these words liked well,
the vow-speech of the Geat; went gold-adorned,
the noble queen of the folk, to sit by her lord.
Then were again, as before, in the hall,
bold words spoken, the people full of joy,
--victory-folk's clamour-- until presently
the son of Half-Dane wished to seek
evening-rest; he knew that the ogre
for the high hall had plotted an attack,
ever since when they the sun's light could see;
and darkening night all over,
shadow-helm's shapes came slithering,
black beneath the skies. The troop all arose;
greeted then the man the other man,
Hrothgar Beowulf, and bid him health,
the wine-hall's ruler, and spoke these words:
'I never to any man before entrusted,
since I hand and shield was able to raise,
this strong-hall of the Danes, save to thee now;
have now and hold this best of houses,
focus on glory, show great valour,
keep watch against the enemy; there shall be no dearth of your desires
if this courage-work you survive with your life.'
Then Hrothgar went with his band of heroes,
the protector of the Scyldings, out of the hall;
he wished to seek Wealhtheow,
the queen as companion in bed; the glory of kings had,
against Grendel, --so men heard--
the hall-guard posted: special duty he held
for the chief of the Danes, ogre-watch he kept.
Indeed the prince of the Geats keenly trusted
in his prodigious power, his Maker's favour,
then he from himself took iron-byrnie,
helm from head, gave his adorned sword,
the choicest of irons, to his retainer,
and commanded him ward his battle-gear;
the good man spoke then some promise-words,
Beowulf of the Geats, before he stepped into bed:
'I myself in martial-stature do not tally poorer
in works of war then Grendel himself;
therefore him with my sword I shall not slay,
deprive of life, though I fully am able;
he knows not the finer skills that he may strike me back,
hew my rimmed-shield, although he is renowned
for malicious works but we at night must
relinquish short sword if he dares to seek
war without weapons, and then wise God,
on whichever hand, the holy Lord
will allot glory, as seems fitting to Him.'
The war-bold one then bent himself down --the cheek-bolster received
the earl's face-- and round him many
brave seaman sank down in hall-slumber;
none of them thought that he thence would
his dear home again ever visit,
his folk or his noble citadel, where he was nurtured
for they had heard that far too many of them already
in that wine-hall slaughtering Death had carried off
of the Danish people. But to them the Lord granted
the woven-destiny of war-luck to the Wederas' men,
solace and support, that they their foe,
through the strength of one, all overcame,
by his own might; truth is known
that mighty God mankind
has ruled forever. In the colourless night came
slinking the shadow-wanderer; the shooters slept,
they that the horned-house were obliged to guard,
all but one --it was known to men
that they could not, when the Maker did not wish it,
by the malefactor be drawn under the shadows--
but he watching in angry indignation
bided in rising rage for the result of battle.
Then came from the moor under the misty cliffs
Grendel walking, God's wrath he bore;
the vile ravager meant from mankind
a sample to snare in the high hall;
he waded under the clouds until he the wine-hall,
--the gold-hall of men-- mostly-certainly saw,
shining gold; it was not the first time
that he Hrothgar's home had sought;
he never in the days of his life, ere nor after,
harder luck or hall-thanes found.
He came then to the hall the fighter journeying,
cut-off from merriment; the door soon rushed open,
firm with fire-forged bands, when he tapped it with his hands
plotting evil then he tore open, now that he was enraged,
the mouth of the building; straight after that
on the tessellated floor the fiend treaded,
advanced angrily; from his eyes issued,
most like a flame, a distorted light;
he saw in the hall many warriors
a sleeping company of kinsmen gathered together
a great host of warriors. Then his heart laughed: he intended to deprive, ere the day came,
the cruel beast, from each one
life from body, now had befallen him
a hope of a full feast. It was not his fate again
that he might more of mankind
partake of after that night; the mighty man beheld,
the kinsman of Hygelac, how the cruel killer
by means of a sudden attack wished to proceed.
That the monster did not think to delay,
but he quickly grasped, at the first occasion,
a sleeping warrior, rended without restraint,
bit into the bone-locks, from the veins drank blood,
swallowed great chunks; soon he had
the unliving one all devoured,
feet and hands; nearer he stepped forth,
taking then with his hands a stout-hearted
warrior from his rest, reached towards him
the foe with his palm; quickly he grasped
the malice thoughts and clamped down on the arm.
At once he found, the shepherd of atrocities,
that he had not met in middle-earth,
in the expanse of the world, in another man
a greater hand-grip; he in his heart grew
fearing for life; none the sooner could he away;
eager-to-go-hence was the thought in him, he wanted to flee into the darkness,
to seek the devils' concourse; his situation there was not
like he in the days of his life ever had met.
The good man then recalled, the kinsman of Hygelac,
his evening-speech; upright he stood
and laid hold of him tight; fingers burst;
the troll was striving to move outward, the earl stepped forward.
The infamous one meant, anywhere he so was able,
farther escape and away thence
flee to his secret places in the fen; he knew his fingers' control
in his enemy's grip, that was a bitter journey he
that the harm-warrior had taken to Heorot.
The noble hall broke into a din; the Danes all were,
--the citadel-dwellers-- each of the bold,
earls in the flood of bitter drink; enraged were both
fierce hall-wards; the hall resounded.
Then it was a great wonder that the wine-hall
withstood the war-fighters, that it did not fall to the ground,
the fair mansion but it so firm was
inside and out with iron-bands
skilfully smithed; there from the floor broke away
many mead-benches, I heard,
adorned with gold, where the enemies struggled;
it was not thought before, by the sages of the Scyldings,
that it ever by means any men
splendid and bone-adorned, could break it up,
cleverly cleave asunder, not unless fire's embrace
swallowed it in inferno. Sound ascended up,
new, nearby: the North-Danes stood
in ghastly horror, in each one of
them who from the wall weeping heard,
terrible screaming, God's adversary,
a victoryless song, bewailing his wound,
Hel's prisoner; he held him fast,
he who was of men in might strongest
on that day in this life.
The protector of earls had no wish for any reason
the murderous guest to release alive,
nor his life-days to any people
counted as advantage. There many brandished
warriors of Beowulf, old heirlooms,
they wished prince-lord's life defend,
the legendary leader's, if they could do so;
they did not know that, when they joined the fray,
the bold-minded battle-men,
and on each side thought to heaw,
to seek the soul: that the sin-scather
any on earth, of the choicest of irons,
of war-bills, none, could not at all greet him
but he victory-weapons had forsworn,
every blade-edge. His life-severing was bound to
on that day in this life
be wretched, and the alien-spirit
into the administration of fiends would journey far away;
then he found, he who before many,
miseries in his mind, on mankind
atrocities committed --he, who fought with God--
that him his body-shell would not obey,
but him the daring kinsman of Hygelac
had by the hand; each was by the other
loathed while living; body-pain he felt,
the awful ogre; on his shoulder was
a great wound apparent, sinows sprang asunder,
bone-locks burst; to Beowulf was
war-glory given; thence Grendel had to
flee sick unto death under the hills of the fen,
to seek his joyless abode; he knew it more surely
that was his life's end arrived,
the day-count of his days. For the Danes were all,
after that slaughter-storm, wishes come to pass:
he had then cleansed, he who had before come from afar,
shrewd and strong-minded, the hall of Hrothgar,
rescued from ruin; in his night's work he rejoiced,
in valour from great deeds; to the East-Danes had
the Geatmen's leader, his oath fulfilled;
so too anguish all remedied,
grievous sorrow, that they had ere endured,
and in hard distress had to suffer,
no small misery; that was a clear sign,
when the battle-bold one the hand placed,
arm and shoulder --there was all together
the grip of Grendel-- under the gaping roof.
Then was in the morning, as I heard tell,
about the gift-hall many warriors,
folk-chiefs arrived from far and near
across wide regions to behold the wonder,
the foe's foot-prints; his parting from life did not
seem mournful to any man
of those who the gloryless foe's track observed,
how he weary away thence,
vanquished by violence, to the nicors' mere
doomed and driven back left behind life-trails.
There with blood was the water seething,
terrible swirling of swells all mingled
with boiling gore, with sword-blood it welled,
doomed to die he hid himself, then, bereft of pleasure,
in his fen-refuge he laid down his life,
his heathen soul; there Hel embraced him.
Thence returned old companions,
also many young, from the sport-chase,
from the mere full-spirited, riding horses,
warriors on fair steeds, there was Beowulf's
glory proclaimed; many often said
that neither south nor north between the seas
over the whole vast earth, no other
under the sky's expanse was ne'er better
shield-bearer, of a worthier kingdom;
nor, however, the friend and lord, did they blame at all,
gracious Hrothgar, for he was a good king.
At times the brave warriors let leap,
in a contest raced fallow horses,
where to them the earth-roads seemed suitable,
and known to be the best. At times the king's thane,
a man laden with fine speech, remembering songs,
he who very many of ancient traditions
recalled scores, found new words
bound in truth; the man then began
Beowulf's exploit skilfully to recite,
and artfully utter an adept tale,
varying his words; he spoke of almost everything
that he of Sigmund had heard said,
of his deeds of glory: many uncanny things,
the striving of Wael's son, his great journeys;
those things of which the childen of men by no means knew,
feuds and feats of arms, only Fitela with him,
then he of such matters was wont to speak of,
uncle to his nephew, as they always were
in every conflict comrades in need;
they had a great many of the giantkind
laid low with swords; for Sigmund arose,
after the day of his death, no little fame,
since the fierce warrior had quelled the great serpent,
the keeper of a hoard; beneath the hoary grey stone he,
the prince's son, alone ventured
a dangerous deed, Fitela was not with him;
however it was granted him that the sword pierced
the wondrous wyrm, so that it stood fixed in the wall,
the noble iron; the dragon perished in the slaughter;
the fearsome one had ensured by courage
that he the ring-hoard might possess
at his own choosing; he loaded the sea-boat,
bore in the bosom of his ship the gleaming treasures,
Wael's son --the wyrm in its heat melted--
he was of adventurers the most widely famed
among nations, the warriors' protector,
for deeds of valour --he had prospered by this--
since Heremod's skirmishing had abated,
affliction and spirit; he among the Etins was
into enemy hands given up,
quickly despatched; the surgings of sorrow him
hindered too long; he to his people became,
to all of the nobles, a great mortal sorrow;
moreover they often mourned, for in earlier times,
the departure of the stouted-hearted king, many learnèd sages
who to him for miseries' remedy had trusted and believed
that that prince's son must prosper,
take up his father's rank, rule the folk,
their treasury and citadel, the heroes' kingdom,
homeland of the Scyldings; he by all became,
the kinsman of Hygelac, by mankind,
more esteemed; wickedness undid him.
Now and then racing, dusky streets
on their mounts they traversed. Then was the morning light
hurried and hastened; many retainers went
determined to the high hall
to see the strange wonder; the king himself too
from his wife's bower, the ward of the ring-hoard,
stepped out splendid with his great troop,
famed for his excellence, and his queen with him,
passed down the meadhall-path, accompanied by maidens.
Hrothgar spoke --he went to the hall,
stood on the steps, observed the steep roof
adorned with gold and Grendel's hand--:
'For this sight Thanks to the All-Ruler
be swiftly forthcoming! I have suffered many injuries,
griefs from Grendel; God can always work
wonder after wonder, glory's Keeper.
It was not long past that I for me any
for woes not hoped for the bredth of my life,
to experience remedy when adorned with blood
the most splendid house stood battle-gory:
woe widespread for each of the sages
those who did not hope that in the span of their lives
the nation's fortress from foes they could protect,
from shucks and shines; now a warrior has,
through the Lord's power, performed a deed
which we all before could not
with schemes contrive; listen, that may say
even so whichever woman as that begot this man,
among mankind, if she yet lives,
that to her the Old Measurer of Fate was gracious
in child-bearing. Now, I, Beowulf, you,
the best of men, for me like a son would
love in life; keep well henceforth
this new kinship; there will not be any want
of worldly wishes while I have power;
full oft I for less rewards have bestowed,
honouring with treasure a humbler man,
lesser at fighting; you for yourself have
