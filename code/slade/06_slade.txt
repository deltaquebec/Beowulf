when it after death suffered a blow,
a hard sword-stroke-- and then its head he cut off.
Suddenly that saw the wise fellows,
who with Hrothgar looked at the lake,
that was turmoil of waves all stirred up
the water coloured with blood; with blended-hair,
aged, about the good man, together they spoke,
that they that noble one did not expect again
that he, triumphing in victory, would come to seek
the glorious ruler; then it many agreed,
that the sea-wolf him had destroyed.
Then came then ninth hour of the day; they abandoned the cape,
the brave Scyldings; he went home hence,
the gold-friend of men; the guests looked about
sick at heart, and stared into the mere,
wished, and did not expect, that they their lord and friend
himself would see. Then that sword began
caused by the gore of battle in icycles of battle,
the war-bill to wane; that was a great wonder
that it all melted, so like ice,
when frost's bond the Father loosens,
unwinds water-ropes, who has control
of times and seaons; that is the true Creator.
He did not take into those dwelling, the leader of the Weder-Geats,
more treasures, though he there saw a great number,
but that head and the hilt as well
shining with ornament; the sword had already melted,
burned up the wavy-patterned blade; that blood was so hot,
the venomous foreign spirit who had perished there inside.
Straightaway he was in the water, he who survived in strife,
the enemies' fall in war; he dove up through the water,
the turmoil of waves was all cleared,
the vast regions, where the alien ghosts
gave up their life-days and this borrowed world;
he came then to the land, the seafarer's leader,
swimming stout-hearted; he rejoiced in the sea-loot,
the great burden, which he had with him.
They went towards him, thanked God,
the mighty band of thanes, they rejoiced for their lord,
that they him sound were able to see;
then the vigorous man was from helm and byrnie
quickly loosened --the water grew still,
the lake under the clouds, stained with the gore of death--
they fared forth thence along foot-paths
happy in their hearts, traversed the trail over the earth,
the familiar streets; the men, bold as kings,
from that lake-cliff bore the head
arduously, for all of them,
full of spirit --four had to
on the pole of the slain to carry with difficulty
to the gold-hall Grendel's head--
until presently they came to the hall,
brave army-keen fourteen
of the Geats moving, with their lord of men,
proud in the throng, trod on the plain near the mead-hall.
Then came in marching the lord of the thanes,
the deed-bold man exalted by glory,
the battle-brave hero, to greet Hrothgar;
then it was by the hair borne to the floor
the head of Grendel, where men were drinking,
dreadful for the earls, and the ladies with them,
a wondrous spectacle; the men stared.
Beowulf spoke, the son of Edgetheow:
'Listen, we you these sea-spoils, son of Half-Dane,
lord of the Scyldings, gladly brought
as token of glory, which you look at here.
I it not easily survived with my life,
war under water, work risked
with trouble; at once was
the warfare at an end, unless God shielded me;
I could not in the battle with Hrunting
bring about anything, though that weapon is excellent
but to me granted men's Ruler
that I saw on the wall hanging fair
a mighty ancient sword --most often He has guided
the one deprived of friend-- that I the weapon drew,
slew then in the strife, when an opportunity was yielded to me,
the house's guardians; then that battle-bill
burned up, wavy-patterned, as the blood leapt out,
the hottest sweat of war; I that hilt thence
carried back from the fiends, foul-deeds avenged,
deadly slaughter of Danes, as it was fitting.
I promise it to you then, that you in Heorot may
sleep without sorrow with your company of soldiers,
and each thane of your nation,
veterans and youths, that you for them need not dread,
chieftain of the Scyldings, on that side,
life-bale for earls, as you did before.'
Then was the golden hilt to the old king
to the grey battle-leader, given into his hand,
the ancient work of giants; it had passed into the possession
after the devils' fall of the lord of the Danes,
the work of wondersmiths, and then this world gave up
the angry-hearted creature, God's adversary
guilty of murder, and his mother also;
it passed into the power of the earthly kings
the finest ones between the two seas,
of those who in Scandinavia dealt out riches.
Hrothgor spoke; he examined the hilt, the old heirloom, on which was engraved the origin
of ancient strife, when the flood slew
the pouring ocean, the race of giants--
they fared terribly; that was a tribe foreign
to the eternal Lord; them the end-reward
through the surging of waters the Ruler granted--
also was on the sword-hilt of shining gold
in rune-staves rightly marked,
it was set down and said, for whom the sword wrought,
--choicest of irons-- had been first,
with a twisted-hilt and serpent-patterned; then the wise man spoke,
the son of Half-Dane all fell silent:
'That, indeed, may say he who truth and right
performs among the folk, remembers all from far-back,
old warden of the homeland; that this hero was
born a greater man; the fame is established
throughout the distant regions, Beowulf my friend,
over each of the nations, of you; all you it with patience hold,
strength with the wisdom of the heart; to you I shall continue to give my
protection, as we spoke of before; you must be as a comfort
all long-lasting to your people,
to heroes a support. Heremod was not so
to the sons of Edgewela, to the Honour-Scyldings;
he grew not to their pleasure, but for slaughter
and for annihilation of the people of the Danes;
he felled in a furious spirit his companions at table,
shoulder-comrades, until he alone passed,
famous king, from the joys of man
though him mighty God with joys of strength
powerfully exalted over all men,
further advanced yet in his heart grew to him
the treasure of the breast eager for blood; not at all did he give rings
to Danes for glory; he lived joylessly,
so that he the strife's pain suffered,
a great evil to the people for a long time. You learn by this,
understand human virtue; I this tale for you
recited, old and wise in winters. Wonder is to say
how mighty God to mankind
according to deep understanding dispenses wisdom,
land and noble qualities; he has control of all;
at times He in delight lets go
the heart's thought of some man of glorious kin
gives to him in his own homeland earthly bliss
to command a stronghold of men,
makes subject to him from the world's portions,
a wide kingdom, that he himself can not
in his ignorance conceive the end of his rule;
he lives on in abundance; they hinder him not a bit,
sickness nor age, nor him evil sorrow
darkens in his soul, nor strife anywhere
sharp-hate appears, but to him all the world
turns on his pleasure; he does not know it worse.
Until within him pride's portion
grows and flourishes then the warder sleeps,
the soul's keeper; the sleep is too sound,
bound with troubles, the killer is very near,
he who from his shaft-bow foully fires;
then it is in the heart struck beneath the helm
by the bitter dart --he cannot protect himself--
from the perversity of strange biddings of the wicked spirit;
it seems to him too little what he rules too long;
cruel-mindedly covets, he in arrogance never gives
golden rings, and he then the future
forgets and disregards, that which God gave him before,
glory's Ruler, a share of honourÂ·
it in the end finally comes to pass
that the body, lent, fails;
fated to death, it falls; another body takes up,
who without regret shares out treasure,
the earl's ancient wealth, and he heeds not fear.
Guard yourself against this wicked strife, beloved Beowulf,
finest man, and for yourself choose the better,
the eternal gains; do not pay heed to pride,
renowned champion; now is the glory of your strength
for a while; presently in turn will be
that you sickness or edge will part from strength,
or grasp of fire, or surge of flood,
or bite of blade, or flight of spear,
or repulsive old-age; or the brightness of the eyes
weakens and dims; very soon will be
that you, warrior, Death overpowers.
So I the Ring-Danes a hundred seasons
have ruled under the skies and in war sheltered them,
from many tribes throughout this middle-earth,
from ash-shafts and sword-edges, so that I for myself any,
under the expanse of the heavens, adversary I did not account.
Listen, to me in the homeland for that a reversal came,
sorrow after joy, since Grendel became
an old contender, invader of mine,
I from that persecution endured continually
great sorrow of spirit; thanks be for that to the Measurer of Fate,
eternal Lord, from that I survived alive,
so that I on the head sword-bloodied
after ancient strife could gaze with my eyes!
Go now to the bench, join in the pleasure-banquet,
honoured by your battle; we must very many
treasures share between us when it is morning.'
The Geat was glad-hearted, went straightaway to
seek the bench, as the wise one had commanded;
then it was again as before for bold warriors,
for those sitting in the hall they prepared a fine feast
once again; the helm of night darkened,
dark over the company of warriors; the veterans all arose;
the blended-haired one wishes to seek his bed,
the aged Scylding; the Geat exceedingly much,
valiant shield-warrior, desired rest;
at once him the hall-thane the weary journeyer
from afar guided forth,
who for courtesy looked after everything
of the hero's needs, such as in those days
warrior-sailors were obliged to have;
rested him then, the large-hearted man; the hall towered
vaulted and gold-adorned; the guest slept inside
until the black raven, the joy of the sky
declared glad-heartedly. Then came bright hurrying,
fighters hastening;
the nobles were back to their people
eager to fare; he wished far thence,
the high-spirited visitor, to seek his ship.
He then directed the tough man to wear Hrunting
the son of Edgelaf, bid him take his sword,
beloved iron; said thanks to him for the loan,
quoth: he the war-friend marked well,
skilled in war; he did not in words blame
the maiche's edge; he was a proud man.
And then, eager to be going, ready in arms,
were the warriors, the one honoured by the Danes went,
noble to the high seat, where the other was,
the battle-bold hero greeted Hrothgar.
Beowulf spoke, the son of Edgetheow:
'Now we sea-farers wish to say
having come from afar, that we are anxious
to seek Hygelac; we here were well
entertained in our desires; you have treated us well.
If then on earth I can do anything
of your affections earn more,
lord of men, than I have done yet,
with feats of arms, I am ready at once,
if I find it out over the flood's expanse,
that you neighbouring-tribes oppress with terror,
as enemies to you sometimes did,
I to you a thousand thanes will bring,
heroes as help. I know of Hygelac,
the lord of the Geats, though he is young,
the keeper of the folk, that he would support me
with words and with deeds, so that I might honour you rightly
and to you in aid bring a forest of spears,
the support of strength, where you be needful of men.
If him, on the other hand, Hrethric to the Geatish court
decides to go, chieftain's son, he shall there be able many
friends to find; distant lands are
better sought by one who is powerful himself.'
Hrothgar spoke to him in reply:
'To you these sayings of words the wise Lord
has sent into mind; I have not heard more intelligently
at such young age man make a speech;
you are strong in power and wise in your heart,
judicious word-speaker; I consider it likely
if it happens, that from you the spear takes,
a horrendous battle Hrethel's heir,
sickness or iron your ruler,
the guardian of the folk, and you have your life,
that the Sea-Geats could not have better
by choosing any other king,
hoard-ward of heroes, if you wish to rule
your kinsman's kingdom. Your spirit and heart me
pleases so well the longer I know them, dear Beowulf;
you have achieved that for the folk shall
the people of the Geats and the Spear-Danes
in mutual peace, and strife subside,
hostilities, which they endured before;
shall be, while I rule the wide kingdom,
wealth in common, many an other
with good things will greet over the gannet's bath;
the ring-prowed ship shall bring over the high seas
offerings and tokens of friendship; I know these nations
both towards foe and towards friend firmly disposed,
blameless in everything, in the ancient manner.'
Then again to him the protector of earls gave to him,
the son of Half-Dane, twelve treasures;
he commanded him with these gifts his own dear nation
to seek in safety, to return quickly;
kissed then, the king the upright noble,
the chieftain of the Scyldings, the best thane
and took him by the neck; tears fell from him,
from the silver and gold whiskers; in him were both thoughts old and deeply wise, the second stronger,
that they afterwards might meet,
brave in a formal summit; the man was so dear to him
that he the welling of his breast could not hold back
but him in his heart in firm bounds of thought
for the dear man a remote longing
burned in his blood. Him Beowulf thence,
warrior proud with gold, trod the grass-mound,
triumphing in treasure. The sea-goer awaited
its lord and owner, which rode at its anchor;
later on the journey was the gift of Hrothgar
often praised; that was one king,
in everything blameless, until age deprived him
of strength's delights, a thing which continually harms many.
They came than to the flood full of spirit
of the young warriors; ring-mail they wore
interlocked limb-shirts; the land-guard perceived
the return of heroes, as he did before;
he did not with insult from the cliff's promontory
greet the guests, but rode towards them,
said that welcome to the people of the Wederas
the fighters with bright covering he went to the ship;
then was on sand the sea-curved boat
laden with war-garments the ringed-prow
with horses and treasure; the mast towered
over Hrothgar's hoard-wealth;
he to the boat-guard a bound gold
sword gave, so that he afterwards was
on the mead-bench by the treasure the worthier,
by the inherited relic. Departed him on the ship
to trouble deep water; he left the Danes' land;
then was by the mast a mighty sea-garment,
