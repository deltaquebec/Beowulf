nobly good, wars survived,
battle-clashes, when armies collided;
it stood by the stone-arch, a stream out from there
breaking out of the barrow; there was the brook's surge
hot with deadly fire, he could not near the hoard
without burning for any space of time
endure the depths on account of the dragon's fire.
Then he let from his breast, when he was angered,
the Weder-Geat's leader, a word burst out,
the staunch-hearted one roared; his voice came in,
ringing battle-clear beneath the hoary grey stone;
hate was aroused, the hoard-guard knew
man's voice; there was not more time
to ask for peace; first came forth
the monster's breath out of the stone,
hot battle-vapour; the earth thundered;
the warrior below the barrow swung his shield-boss
against the terror-guest, the Geats' lord;
then was the ring-coiled one's heart incited
to seek strife; his sword before drew
the good war-king, ancient heirloom,
imprudent with sword-edges; was in each
of the harm-intending ones terror of the other;
firm-spirited stood with his steep bossed-shield
the brave leader of the friends, while the serpent coiled
together swiftly; He in war-gear waited;
went then burning gliding coiled,
hastening to his destiny; the shield defended well
life and body for a lesser time
the famed chieftain, then his mind desired,
where he that time for the first day
had to wield it, as Fate had not decreed for him
glory in battle: he raised up his hand,
the Geatish lord; the ghastly-hued one he struck
with his ancestral sword, so that the edge weakened
bright on bone, bit less fiercely
than its tribe-king had need
driven in distress. Then the barrow's ward was
after the war-blow in a fierce spirit;
he spewed slaughter-fire; widely spread
battle-light. Of war-victory did not boast
the gold-friend of the Geats; his war-bill failed,
naked in the violence, as it should not have,
the excellent old iron; that was not an easy accomplishment,
that the famed son of Edgetheow
this earth should be willing to give up;
he was obliged to be about to inhabit a dwelling
elsewhere, as must every man
abandon loaned-days. It was not long to when
that the fierce enemies again met each other:
the hoard-guardian heartened himself, his breast swelled with breath,
another time; cruelly suffered,
encircled in fire, he who had once ruled a nation.
Not at all him in a troop the hand-companions,
nobles' sons, around him stood
with valour in battle, but they sunk to the forest,
to protect life; in one of them surged
his heart with sorrows; kinship can never
aught be altered, in him who thinks properly.
Wiglaf he was called, son of Weohstan,
noble shield-fighter, man of the Scylfings,
kinsman of Ã†lfhere; he saw his liege-lord
under the war-mask suffering heat;
he remembered then the honour that he had given him before,
lush dwelling-place of the Waegmundings,
to each folk-rights, as his father had owned;
then he could not hold back, his hand seized his round shield,
yellow lindenwood, he drew his ancient sword;
it was among men the legacy of Eanmund,
son of Ohthere; of him in battle was,
of the friendless exile, Weohstan his slayer
by maiche's edges, and to his kinsman he brought back
bright-gleaming helm, ringed byrnie,
an old ogrish sword; that to him Onela returned,
his kinsman's war-garment,
war-devised clothing; he did not speak of the feud,
though he his brother's son had slain;
he held the treasures for many seasons,
bill and byrnie, until his son could
accomplish noble deeds like his old father;
then, among the Geats, he gave him war-clothing,
of all kinds, in countless number, then he went from life,
wise, on the way forth. Then was the first time
for the young champion, that he the rush of war
with his noble lord had to perform;
his spirited heart in him did not melt away, nor the remainder of his strength
fail in the fight; then the wyrm had discovered,
when they together had come.
Wiglaf spoke, many proper words
he said to his companions --his heart was sad in him--:
'I recall that time, where we partook of mead,
when we promised to our lord
in the beer-hall, he who gave us rings,
that we to him for the war-gear wished to repay,
if for him such a need arose,
with helmets and hard swords. Because of that he chose us from the army
for this adventure of his own desire;
he deemed us worthy of renown, and gave me these treasures,
because he us spear-warriors considered excellent,
bold helm-bearers, though the lord for us
this valiant work intended alone
to perform, the keeper of the folk,
because he of men the most glories has achieved,
the most audacious deeds. Now is the day come
that our liege-lord has need of strength
of good war-men; let us go to,
aid the battle-leader, while the heat lasts,
the fierce fire-terror. God knows of me
that to me it is much more agreeable, that my body
with my gold-giver the fire embraces;
it does not seem proper to me, that we bear shields
back to our land, unless we first can
fell the foe, defend the life
of the chief of the Wederas; I know well,
that his deeds of old are not such, that he alone should
of the Geats' retinue sorrow suffer,
to sink in strife; for the two of us must sword and helm,
byrnie and rich shroud both share.'
Then he waded through the smoke of slaughter, bore his war-head
to the support of his lord; a few words he spoke:
'Dear Beowulf, carry out all well,
as you in youth-life long ago said,
that you would not allow, with you still living,
glory to fail; you must now in bold deeds,
a noble firm in mind, with all of your strength,
defend your life; I shall support you.'
After those words the wrathful wyrm came,
awful cruel visitor a second time,
with hostile, gleaming flood of fire to seek his foes
the hated humans; the flame came forth in waves,
burned shield to the boss; the byrnie could not
to the young spear-fighter lend support
but the young man, under his kinsman's shield
courageously advanced, when his own was
consumed by fire. Then again the war-king
remembered his strength, with mighty force struck
with his battle-bill, so that it stood in the serpent's head
driven by violence; Naegling burst asunder,
failed in the fight Beowulf's sword
ancient and silver-streaked; it was not granted to him,
that for him irons' edges could
help in battle: the hand was too strong,
that each one of the blades --I heard--
in stroke he over-taxed; when he bore to battle
a weapon hardened by wounds, it was not any better for him.
Then the scourge of people a third time,
the fierce fire-drake enmity in mind,
rushed at the brave man, when he was yielded space,
hot and battle-fierce, Beowulf's whole neck he clamped
between sharp fangs; he was drenched
in life-blood; gore gushed in waves.
I heard that then at the need of the folk-king
the nobleman alongside displayed courage,
strength and boldness, as was natural to him;
he did not heed the dragon's head, though the hand was burned
of the spirited man, there he his strength helped,
that he the hostile outsider struck somewhat lower,
the warrior in his war-gear, so that the sword sank in
gleaming and golden so that the fire began
to weaken after that. Then again the king himself
gathered his wits, drew a slaughter-seax
bitter and battle-sharp, that he wore on his byrnie;
The Helm of the Wederas cut through the wyrm in the middle.
The foe they felled --their courage driving out life--
and then the both of them him had destroyed,
the noble kinsmen; so ought a man to be,
a thane in need. That was for the chieftain
the last time of victory by his own deeds,
in the world of action. Then the wound began,
which him the earth-dragon had caused earlier,
to swelter and to swell; he soon discovered that,
it him in the breast welled with deadly evil,
poison inside. Then the noble went,
so that he by the wall wise in thought
sat on a seat; he looked on the giants' work
how the stone-arches on firm pillars
the eternal earth-hall supported within.
Then with his hands, sword-bloody,
the renowned chieftain, the immensely good thane
his friend and lord washed with water,
weary of battle, and unfastened his helm;
Beowulf spoke; he spoke despite his injury,
the slaughter-wretched wound --he readily knew
that he the length of his days had fulfilled,
joy of earth; then was all departed
his number of days, death exceedingly near
'Now I to my son I would have wished to give
war-garments, if it had been granted to me such that
any guardian of inheritance would be after
this body remaining; I ruled the people
fifty winters; there was not a folk-king
of my neighbours --of any of them--
who me with war-friends dared to greet,
to threaten with terror; I on earth awaited
destiny, ruled my own well,
did not seek cunning hostility, nor swore me many
oaths unjustly; I all of it can,
sick with mortal-injuries, have rejoicing,
because he will not need to reproach me, the Ruler of men,
for dire murder of kin, when departs my
life from body. Now go you quickly
to examine the hoard under the hoary grey stone,
dear Wiglaf, now the wyrm lies dead,
sleeping sorely wounded, deprived of treasure
be now in haste, that I the ancient wealth,
the possession of gold might perceive, readily behold
sparkling cleverly-cut gems, so that I can the more pleasantly
for treasure-wealth leave my
life and nation, that long I ruled.'
Then I heard swiftly the son of Weohstan,
after the word-speech the wounded lord,
listened to the battle-sick one, bore a net of rings,
woven battle-shirt under the barrow's roof.
He saw then victorious, when he went by the seat,
the spirited young thane, many precious jewels,
glittering gold close to the ground,
wonders on the wall, and the wyrm's den,
the old twilight-flier, beakers standing,
the vessels of men of old lacking a burnisher,
stripped of adornments; there was a multitude of helms
old and rusty, many arm-rings
cleverly fastened --treasure easily may,
gold in the ground, any one of mankind
overpower, hide he who will--
also he saw hanging a standard all-golden
high over the hoard, the greatest of hand-wrought wonders,
linked with skill of hands; from it light issued,
so that he on the ground could perceive,
look over the ornament; there was not of the wyrm
any appearance, for him the blade-edge took.
Then I heard in the mound the hoard plundered,
old work of giants, one man,
him on his bosom loaded goblets and plates
of his own judgement he also took the banner,
the brightest beacon; the bill had already wounded
--the edge was iron-- of that old lord
him who the treasures' protector was
for a long while; the fire-terror had endured
hot for sake of the hoard, fiercely welling up
in the middle of nights until he died in violence.
The messenger was in haste, eager for return,
urged on by treasures; curiosity burst in him,
whether bold-hearted he would meet alive
in that place, the chief of the Wederas
ill in strength, where he had left him earlier;
he then with that treasures to the glorious chieftain,
his lord, found bleeding,
of life at an end; he again began on him
to sprinkle water, until the word's point
broke through the breast-hoard,
the old one on the youth saw gold:
'I, for these riches, to the Lord of All, thanks
to the Glory-King say by words,
to the eternal Lord, which I look on here,
that I was able for my people
before my death-day to gain such riches,
now I for the hoard of treasures have paid with my
old span of life. Tend still
the need of the nation. I cannot be here longer;
order war-famed men to construct a mound
bright after the fire, at the ocean's cape;
it shall to remind my people
tower high on headland of whales,
so that it sea-farers then will name
Beowulf's Barrow, those who ships
over the seas' mists drive from afar.'
Took him from his neck the golden ring,
the valiant chief, to the thane gave,
to the young spear-warrior, gold-adorned helm,
ring and byrnie, told him to use them well:
'You are the last remainder of our race,
of the Waegmundings; Fate has swept off all
of my kinsmen into destined death,
earls in their strength; I must go after them.'
That was for the old man the final word
of the thoughts of his breast, ere he chose funeral fire,
hot furious seething; yet from him went
his soul to seek truth-fast judgement.
Then it went with the young man
painfully, that he saw on the ground
the dearest man at the end of his life
miserably enduring; the slayer also lay,
the terrible earth-dragon bereft of life,
balefully beaten down; the ring-hoard longer
the wickedly coiled wyrm could not control,
rather him irons' edges took off,
the hard, battle-notched leavings of hammers,
so that the wide-flier, stilled by wounds,
fell to the ground near the hoard-store;
not at all through the air flying turned
in the middle of nights, proud of his prized possessions,
manifested an appearance, but he fell to earth
by the battle-leader's work of his own hands.
Indeed it on land few men succeeded,
possessors of strength, I have heard,
though he in all deeds were daring;
that he against the poison-scourge's breath rushed,
or its ring-hall stirred up with hands,
if he a watching warden found
living in the barrow; for Beowulf was
the noble treasures' share, repaid with death;
each of them had arrived at the end
of his loaned life. It was not long to when
that the battle-shirkers gave up the forest,
cowardly troth-breakers, ten together,
who had not dared before with javelins to fight
in their liege-lord's great need
but they, shamed, bore shields,
war-clothing, to where the old man lay;
they looked at Wiglaf; he sat wearied,
the foot-soldier near the shoulders of his lord;
he tried to rouse him with water, but it availed him not a bit;
he could not on earth, though he wished well,
in that first-spear preserve life,
nor the Ruler's man turn back:
