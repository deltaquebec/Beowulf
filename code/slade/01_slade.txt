Listen! We --of the Spear-Danes in the days of yore,
of those clan-kings-- heard of their glory.
how those nobles performed courageous deeds.
Often Scyld, Scef's son, from enemy hosts
from many peoples seized mead-benches;
and terrorised the fearsome Heruli after first he was
found helpless and destitute, he then knew recompense for that:-
he waxed under the clouds, throve in honours,
until to him each of the bordering tribes
beyond the whale-road had to submit,
and yield tribute:- that was a good king!
To him an heir was born then
young in the yards, God sent him
to comfort the people; He had seen the dire distress
that they suffered before, leader-less
a long while; them for that the Life-Lord,
Ruler of Glory, granted honour on earth:
Beowulf Beaw was famed --his renown spread wide--
Scyld's heir, in Northern lands.
So ought a young man by good deeds deserve,
and by fine treasure-gifts, while in his father's keeping,
that him in old age shall again stand by,
willing companions, when war comes,
people serve him: by glorious deeds must,
amongst his people, everywhere, one prosper.
Then Scyld departed at the destined time,
still in his full-strength, to fare in the protection of the Lord Frea;
he they carried to the sea's surf,
his dear comrades, as he himself had bid,
when he yet wielded words, that friend of the Scyldings,
beloved ruler of the land, had ruled for a long time;
there at the harbour stood with a ringed-prow,
icy and keen to sail, a hero's vessel;
they then laid down the beloved prince,
the giver of rings and treasure, in the bosom of the boat,
the mighty by the mast; many riches were there,
from far-off lands ornate armour and baubles were brought;
I have not heard of a comelier keel adorned
with weapons of battle and war-dress,
bill-blades and byrnies; there lay on his breast
many treasures, which with him must,
in the power of the waves, drift far off;
in no way had they upon him fewer gifts bestowed
with the wealth of a nation, than those did
who him in the beginning had sent forth
alone upon the waves being but a child;
yet then they set up the standard of gold,
high over head; they let the sea bear,
gave to the ocean, in them were troubled hearts,
mourning minds; men cannot
say for certain, neither court-counsellors
nor heroes under heaven, who received that cargo.
Then was in boroughs, Beowulf the Scylding Beaw,
beloved king of the people a long age
famed among the folk --his father having gone elsewhere,
elder on earth-- until unto him in turn was born
high Half-Dane, he ruled so long as he lived
old and battle-fierce, the glad Scyldings;
to him four sons in succession
woke in the world, the leader of the legions:
Heorogar and Hrothgar and good Halga;
I heard that Yrse was Onela's queen,
the War-Scylfing's belov√®d embraced in bed.
Then was to Hrothgar success in warcraft given,
honour in war, so that his retainers
eagerly served him until the young war-band grew
into a mighty battalion; it came into his mind
that a hall-house, he wished to command,
a grand mead-hall, be built by men
which the sons of men should hear of forever,
and there within share out all
to young and old, such as God gave him,
except the common land and the lives of men;
Then, I heard, widely was the work commissioned
from many peoples throughout this middle-earth,
to furnish this hall of the folk. For him in time it came to pass,
early, through the men, that it was fully finished,
the best of royal halls; he named it Heorot,
he whose words weight had everywhere;
he did not lie when he boasted; rings he dealt out,
riches at his feasts. The hall towered,
high and horn-gabled; it awaited the cruel surges
of hateful flames; nor was the time yet nigh
that the furious edge-malice of son-in-law and father-in-law,
arising from deadly enmity would inevitably awaken.
Then the bold spirit, impatiently
endured dreary time, he who dwelt in darkness,
he that every day heard noise of revelry
loud in the hall; there was the harmony of the harp,
the sweet song of the poet; he spoke who knew how the origin of men to narrate from afar;
said he that the almighty one wrought the earth,
that fair, sublime field bounded by water;
set up triumphant the sun and moon,
luminaries as lamps for the land-dwellers
and adorned the corners of the earth
with limbs and leaves; life too He formed
for each of the species which lives and moves.
So the lord's men lived in joys,
happily, until one began
to execute atrocities, a fiend in hell;
this ghastly demon was named Grendel,
infamous stalker in the marches, he who held the moors,
fen and desolate strong-hold; the land of marsh-monsters,
the wretched creature ruled for a time
since him the Creator had condemned
with the kin of Cain; that killing avenged
the eternal Lord, in which he slew Abel;
this feud he did not enjoy, for He drove him far away,
the Ruler, for this crime, from mankind;
thence unspeakable offspring all awoke:
ogres and elves and spirits from the underworld;
also giants, who strove with God
for an interminable season; He gave them their reward for that.
He then went to visit and see --when night came--
the high house how it, the Ring-Danes
after the beer-feast, had occupied;
he found then therein the nobles' company
slumbering after the feast; they did not know sorrow,
misery of men; that damned creature,
grim and greedy, soon was ready,
savage and cruel and from their rest seized
thirty thanes; thence back he went
proud in plunder to his home, faring
with the banquet of bodies to seek his shelter.
Then was in the dark of dawn before the day
Grendel's war-might revealed to the men;
then it was after their feasting they raised up lament
in a great morning-cry. The mighty chieftain,
the prince, old and good, sat in sorrow,
The great mighty one suffered, anguish of thane-loss oppressed him
when they the foe's tracks beheld,
of the wicked ghoul; that strife was too strong,
loathsome and lingering. Nor was it a longer time
but after a single night again he perpetuated
more brutal slaughter, and it grieved him not,
violence and viciousness, he was too entrenched in these.
Then was it easily found, one who would somewhere else,
further away, seek rest:
a bed among the bowers, when it was made clear to him,
truly told, by an unmistakable token
the enmity of the hall's occupier; he held himself then
further and safer, he who shunned that fiend.
Thus he ruled and challenged justice,
one against all, until empty stood
that finest of houses; the time was long
--the space of twelve winters-- that bitter anguish endured
the friend, the shielder, --every woe, immense miseries; therefore to men became
to sons of men, clearly known
in mournful ballads, that Grendel had contended
long against Hrothgar, sustained fierce enmity,
felony and feud, for many seasons
continual strife; he did not want peace
with any man of the Danish contingent,
to desist in life-destruction, to settle it with payment,
none of the counsellors had any need to hope for
noble recompense from the slayer's hands,
but the wretch was persecuting
--the dark death-shade-- warriors old and young;
he lay in wait and set snares, in the endless night he held
the misty moors; men do not know
where such hellish enigmas slink in their haunts.
Thus many offences that foe of mankind,
that terrible lone traveller, often committed,
hard humiliations; he dwelt in Heorot,
the richly-adorned hall, in the black nights
--by no means he the gift-throne was compelled to approach respectfully,
the treasure, by the Maker, nor did he feel love for it--
That was great misery for the Friend of the Scyldings,
a breaking of his spirit. Many often sat
the mighty at counsel; pondered a plan,
what by strong-minded men would be best,
against the sudden horror, to do;
sometimes they pledged at holy temples
sacred honouring, in words bid
that them the demon-slayer would offer succour
from the plight of the people; such was their habit:
the hope of heathens; on hell they pondered in the depths of their hearts; the Creator they did not know,
the Judge of deeds, they were not aware of the Lord God,
nor yet they the Helm of the Heavens were able to honour,
Glory's Wielder. Woe be to him who must,
through dire terror, thrust his soul
into fire's embrace; hope not for relief,
or to change at all; well be he who may
after death-day seek the Lord
and in his Father's arms yearn towards Nirvana.
So then over the sorrow of the time the son of Half-Dane
continually brooded; the wise hero could not
turn away woe; that strife was too strong,
hateful and enduring, that on the people came
fearfully cruel, violent trouble, the greatest night-evil.
That from home heard Hygelac's thane,
a good man of the Geats, of Grendel's deeds;
he was of mankind of the greatest strength,
on that day in this life,
noble and mighty; he ordered them a wave-crosser
--a good one-- prepare; he said: the war-king
over swan-road he wished to seek,
that mighty clan-chief, since he was in need of men;
that adventure him, the clear-headed chaps,
very little begrudged though he was dear to them,
they urged on the valiant-hearted one, and observed the omens.
The worthy one had, from the Geatish peoples,
chosen champions, those who were the boldest he
could find; fifteen together,
they sought the sea-wood, he led the warriors,
that sea-skilled man, to the boundary of the shore.
Time passed by; the ship was on the waves,
the boat under the cliffs; the ready warriors
stepped up into the prow --the currents curled round,
sea against sand-- the men bore
into the bosom of boat bright arms and armour,
noble war-gear; the fellows shoved off,
men on a welcome voyage, in a well-braced ship.
Then they went over the water-waves urged by the wind,
the foamy-necked floater, remarkably bird-like
until in due time, on the second day,
the curved-prow had made the journey,
so that the sailors sighted land,
bright sea-cliffs, towering shores,
wide headlands; then was the sea traversed,
their sea-voyage at an end. Thence up quickly
the Wederas-warriors stepped onto land;
moored their vessel; their mail-shirts clanked
those war-garments; they thanked God
that for them the wave-paths had been smooth.
Then from the wall saw the ward of the Scyldings,
he who the sea-cliffs had the duty to guard,
borne over the gang-plank, bright bossed-shields,
eager war-devices; in him curiosity broke
the thoughts of his heart: what these men were;
then he went to the shore riding his horse,
the thane of Hrothgar; he forcefully shook
his mighty wooden shaft, and with formal words asked:
'What are you armour-wearers
bound in byrnies, who thus your tall keel
over the sea-street leading came,
hither over the waters?'
He was the coast-guardian, he held the sea-watch,
so that on Danish land no enemies at all
with a navy would not be able to ravage.
'Not here more openly began to come
lindenwood shield-bearers, nor you the leave-word
of our war-makers certainly don't know
our kinsmen's consent; never have I seen greater
noble on earth than the one that you are,
warrior in armour; this is no mere retainer
made worthy by weapons; unless he is belied by his looks,
a unique appearance! Now I must your
lineage learn, ere you far hence,
deceiving spies in the land of the Danes
further fare; now you far-dwellers
you sea-sailors, hear my
one-fold thought: speed is best
for reporting, whence your comings are.'
He the eldest answered,
the crew's captain, he unlocked his word-hoard:
'We are of the tribe of the Geat people
and Hygelac's hearth-companions;
my father was known to the folk,
a noble vanguard-warrior, called Edgetheow,
who saw many winters ere he passed away,
old, from our courtyards; he is readily recalled
by each one of the wise widely throughout the world.
We, by resolute resolve, your lord,
the son of Half-Dane have come to seek,
that protector of the people; be you a good guide to us;
we have, to that grand one, a great errand
to the Danish lord; there shouldn't some secret
be of this, I think. You know if it is
as we truly have heard said,
that amongst the Scyldings, some enemy, I know not what,
a furtive despoiler, in dark nights,
sickeningly reveals unknown enmity,
suffering and slaughter. I can on this matter, to Hrothgar,
from a spacious spirit, give counsel,
how he, wise and good, overcome the fiend--
if for him a change ever should,
from this suffering of miseries to remedy, come after--
and his hot wellings of melancholic care grow cooler;
or else ever after, a time of torment,
horrible hardship he will endure, so long as there remains,
in its high place, that best of houses.
The guard made a speech, sitting there on his horse,
--the unhesistating officer: 'He will --every
sharp shield-warrior-- know the distinction
between words and works, he who reasons rightly.
I hear it, that this is a legion loyal
to the lord of the Scyldings; go forth bearing
weapons and armour; I shall guide you;
likewise, I the kin-thanes of mine will order,
against any foes your vessel,
--newly tarred, ship on the sand--
to guard in honour, until it bears back,
over the sea-streams, the dear man,
--the swoop-necked wood -- to Wedermark;
those who perform noble deeds-- to such as these it shall be granted
that the battle-rush he survive in one piece.'
Then they went faring --the boat at rest awaited,
it rode on the sand the broad-bosomed ship,
on anchor fast-- boar-figures shone
atop cheekguards adorned with gold;
glittering and fire-hard; life-guard they held;
war-spirits raised; the men hastened,
marched forward together, until they the timbered hall,
glorious and gold-trimmed, were able to glimpse;
that was the foremost --for earth-dwellers--
of halls under the heavens, in it the ruler dwelt;
its light glimmered over many lands.
Then to them the fierce fellow --to that court of great men
glorious-- he lead, that they to it could
go directly; the worthy warrior
turned his horse, thereupon spoke words:
'Time it is for me to go. The Father all-ruling,
with grace may He hold you
sound on your sojourns! I will to the sea,
